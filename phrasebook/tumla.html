<p>Lojbangug (or Lojbanistan) is on an island. The two cities are Bertcad, the capital,
in the west, and Xagvar, a fishing and boating center, in the southwest.
Bertcad also has a thriving electronics industry. The rest of the country
is mountainous and largely agrarian.</p>
<p>In the northeast corner is Loglandia. This country used to rule the whole island,
but a revolt several decades ago overthrew it except in that corner. With the
death of the Loglandian chief, the country lacks the strength to retake the island.
The people of Loglandia speak a related, but not mutually intelligible, language.</p>
