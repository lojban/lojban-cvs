<p>If a word has a consonant cluster or ends in a consonant, it is accented
on the next-to-last syllable, unless the vowel in that syllable is y, in which
case the syllable before that is accented, unless marked otherwise by capitalizing. If it
has no consonant clusters and ends in a vowel, it may be accented anywhere or nowhere,
but if it is accented on the last syllable, a pause may be necessary after it to
prevent confusion.</p>
<p>Sometimes a small change makes a big difference. For instance, "mi djica
tu'a lo bakyrectu" means "I would like some beef"; but drop the "y" and you
get "mi djica tu'a lo ba krectu", which means "I would like someone who
will teach about hair".</p>
<h2>Dialects</h2>
<p><i>ntc</i> and <i>ndj</i> do not occur in Lojban, but in southern Lojbangug
<i>nc</i> and <i>nj</i> are pronounced as <i>ntc</i> and <i>ndj</i>.</p>
<p>In the east, which is on the border with Loglandia, there is a tendency
to drop y'ybu, saying <i>a'ope'i</i> as <i>aope,i</i></p>
<p>In some hick towns, you will find incomprehensible slurvian. If this happens,
say "e'o ko masno bacru tezu'e lenu mi jimpe" (Please speak slowly so that I can
understand).</p>
<p>Some foreigners have trouble with consonant clusters such as <i>ml</i> and
<i>jb</i> and insert a short vowel in them. If you do this, be sure to distinguish
this vowel (called a "buffer") from <i>y</i>.</p>
