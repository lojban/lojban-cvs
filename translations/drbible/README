THIS DIRECTORY IS OBSOLETE
Please see https://github.com/phma/lojban-bible/, which contains the
translated text converted to USFM, a standard format for Bible translations.
For write access, ask Pierre Abbat.
------------------
This is the directory for the effort to translate The Bible into lojban.
The first file is 'drbible.texinfo', which contains information on
modifying texinfo files.  The rest of the files are named after the
books they contain (there are 12 chapters).

Note that I've been told this is a pretty bad translation, so check your
work using the various online bible search engines.

Please don't start at the beginning!  That's where everyone will start!
Pick your own spot.
