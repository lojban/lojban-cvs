@c    THE BOOK OF DEUTERONOMY
KE'UFLA

.iva'i

DI'E VALSI

@c    This Book is called DEUTERONOMY, which signifies a SECOND LAW, because
@c    it repeats and inculcates the ordinances formerly given on mount Sinai,
@c    with other precepts not expressed before.  The Hebrews, from the first
@c    words in the book, call it ELLE HADDEBARIM.



@c    Deuteronomy Chapter 1


@c    A repetition of what passed at Sinai and Cadesbarne:  and of the
@c    people's murmuring and their punishment.

@c    1:1. These are the words, which Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the
@c    Jordan, in the plain wilderness, over against the Red Sea, between
@c    Pharan and Thophel and Laban and Haseroth, where there is very much
@c    gold.

joi la lyVAN. joi la xatseROT. joi la diza'AV.

@c    1:2. Eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir to
@c    Cadesbarne.

@c    1:3. In the fortieth year, the eleventh month, the first day of the
@c    month, Moses spoke to the children of Israel all that the Lord had
@c    commanded him to say to them:

@c    1:4. After that he had slain Sehon king of the Amorrhites, who dwelt in
@c    Hesebon:  and Og king of Basan who abode in Astaroth, and in Edrai,

@c    1:5. Beyond the Jordan in the land of Moab.  And Moses began to expound
@c    the law, and to say:

@c    1:6. The Lord our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying:  You have stayed
@c    long enough in this mountain:

@c    1:7. Turn you, and come to the mountain of the Amorrhites, and to the
@c    other places that are next to it, the plains and the hills and the
@c    vales towards the south, and by the sea shore, the land of the
@c    Chanaanites, and of Libanus, as far as the great river Euphrates.

@c    1:8. Behold, said he, I have delivered it to you:  go in and possess it,
@c    concerning which the Lord swore to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and
@c    Jacob, that he would give it to them, and to their seed after them.

@c    1:9. And I said to you at that time:

@c    1:10. I alone am not able to bear you:  for the Lord your God hath
@c    multiplied you, and you are this day as the stars of heaven, for
@c    multitude.

@c    1:11. (The Lord God of your fathers add to this number many thousands,
@c    and bless you as he hath spoken.)

@c    1:12. I alone am not able to bear your business, and the charge of you
@c    and your differences.

@c    1:13. Let me have from among you wise and understanding men, and such
@c    whose conversation is approved among your tribes, that I may appoint
@c    them your rulers.

@c    1:14. Then you answered me:  The thing is good which thou meanest to do.

@c    1:15. And I took out of your tribes men wise and honourable, and
@c    appointed them rulers, tribunes, and centurions, and officers over
@c    fifties, and over tens, who might teach you all things.

@c    1:16. And I commanded them, saying:  Hear them, and judge that which is
@c    just:  whether he be one of your country, or a stranger.

@c    1:17. There shall be no difference of persons, you shall hear the
@c    little as well as the great:  neither shall you respect any man's
@c    person, because it is the judgment of God.  And if any thing seem hard
@c    to you, refer it to me, and I will hear it.

@c    1:18. And I commanded you all things that you were to do.

@c    1:19. And departing from Horeb, we passed through the terrible and vast
@c    wilderness, which you saw, by the way of the mountain of the Amorrhite,
@c    as the Lord our God had commanded us.  And when we were come into
@c    Cadesbarne,

@c    1:20. I said to you:  You are come to the mountain of the Amorrhite,
@c    which the Lord our God will give to us.

@c    1:21. See the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee:  go up and
@c    possess it, as the Lord our God hath spoken to thy fathers:  fear not,
@c    nor be any way discouraged.

@c    1:22. And you came all to me, and said:  Let us send men who may view
@c    the land, and bring us word what way we shall go up, and to what cities
@c    we shall go.

@c    1:23. And because the saying pleased me, I sent of you twelve men, one
@c    of every tribe:

@c    1:24. Who, when they had set forward and had gone up to the mountains,
@c    came as far as the valley of the cluster:  and having viewed the land,

@c    1:25. Taking of the fruits thereof, to shew its fertility, they brought
@c    them to us, and said:  The land is good, which the Lord our God will
@c    give us.

@c    1:26. And you would not go up, but being incredulous to the word of the
@c    Lord our God,

@c    1:27. You murmured in your tents, and said:  The Lord hateth us, and
@c    therefore he hath brought us out of the land of Egypt, that he might
@c    deliver us into the hand of the Amorrhite, and destroy us.

@c    1:28. Whither shall we go up?  the messengers have terrified our hearts,
@c    saying:  The multitude is very great, and taller than we:  the cities are
@c    great, and walled up to the sky, we have seen the sons of the Enacims
@c    there.

@c    Walled up to the sky. . .A figurative expression, signifying the walls
@c    to be very high.

@c    1:29. And I said to you:  Fear not, neither be ye afraid of them:

@c    1:30. The Lord God, who is your leader, himself will fight for you, as
@c    he did in Egypt in the sight of all.

@c    1:31. And in the wilderness (as thou hast seen) the Lord thy God hath
@c    carried thee, as a man is wont to carry his little son, all the way
@c    that you have come, until you came to this place.

@c    1:32. And yet for all this you did not believe the Lord your God,

@c    1:33. Who went before you in the way, and marked out the place, wherein
@c    you should pitch your tents, in the night shewing you the way by fire,
@c    and in the day by the pillar of a cloud.

@c    1:34. And when the Lord had heard the voice of your words, he was angry
@c    and swore, and said:

@c    1:35. Not one of the men of this wicked generation shall see the good
@c    land, which I promised with an oath to your fathers:

@c    1:36. Except Caleb the son of Jephone:  for he shall see it, and to him
@c    I will give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children,
@c    because he hath followed the Lord.

@c    1:37. Neither is his indignation against the people to be wondered at,
@c    since the Lord was angry with me also on your account, and said:
@c    Neither shalt thou go in thither.

@c    1:38. But Josue the son of Nun, thy minister, he shall go in for thee:
@c    exhort and encourage him, and he shall divide the land by lot to
@c    Israel.

@c    1:39. Your children, of whom you said that they should be led away
@c    captives, and your sons who know not this day the difference of good
@c    and evil, they shall go in:  and to them I will give the land, and they
@c    shall possess it.

@c    1:40. But return you and go into the wilderness by the way of the Red
@c    Sea.

@c    1:41. And you answered me:  We have sinned against the Lord:  we will go
@c    up and fight, as the Lord our God hath commanded.  And when you went
@c    ready armed unto the mountain,

@c    1:42. The Lord said to me:  Say to them:  Go not up, and fight not, for I
@c    am not with you:  lest you fall before your enemies.

@c    1:43. I spoke, and you hearkened not:  but resisting the commandment of
@c    the Lord, and swelling with pride, you went up into the mountain.

@c    1:44. And the Amorrhite that dwelt in the mountains coming out, and
@c    meeting you, chased you, as bees do:  and made slaughter of you from
@c    Seir as far as Horma.

@c    1:45. And when you returned and wept before the Lord, he heard you not,
@c    neither would he yield to your voice.

@c    1:46. So you abode in Cadesbarne a long time.



@c    Deuteronomy Chapter 2


@c    They are forbid to fight against the Edomites, Moabites, and Ammonites.
@c    Their victory over Sehon king of Hesebon.

@c    2:1. And departing from thence we came into the wilderness that leadeth
@c    to the Red Sea, as the Lord had spoken to me:  and we compassed mount
@c    Seir a long time.

@c    2:2. And the Lord said to me:

@c    2:3. You have compassed this mountain long enough:  go toward the north:

@c    2:4. And command thou the people, saying:  You shall pass by the borders
@c    of your brethren the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, and they will
@c    be afraid of you.

@c    2:5. Take ye then good heed that you stir not against them.  For I will
@c    not give you of their land so much as the step of one foot can tread
@c    upon, because I have given mount Seir to Esau, for a possession.

@c    2:6. You shall buy meats of them for money and shall eat:  you shall
@c    draw waters for money, and shall drink.

@c    2:7. The Lord thy God hath blessed thee in every work of thy hands:  the
@c    Lord thy God dwelling with thee, knoweth thy journey, how thou hast
@c    passed through this great wilderness, for forty years, and thou hast
@c    wanted nothing.

@c    2:8. And when we had passed by our brethren the children of Esau, that
@c    dwelt in Seir, by the way of the plain from Elath and from Asiongaber,
@c    we came to the way that leadeth to the desert of Moab.

@c    2:9. And the Lord said to me:  Fight not against the Moabites, neither
@c    go to battle against them:  for I will not give thee any of their land,
@c    because I have given Ar to the children of Lot in possession.

@c    2:10. The Emims first were the inhabitants thereof, a people great, and
@c    strong, and so tall, that like the race of the Enacims,

@c    2:11. They were esteemed as giants, and were like the sons of the
@c    Enacims.  But the Moabites call them Emims.

@c    2:12. The Horrhites also formerly dwelt in Seir:  who being driven out
@c    and destroyed, the children of Esau dwelt there, as Israel did in the
@c    land of his possession, which the Lord gave him.

@c    2:13. Then rising up to pass the torrent Zared, we came to it.

@c    2:14. And the time that we journeyed from Cadesbarne till we passed
@c    over the torrent Zared, was thirty-eight years:  until all the
@c    generation of the men that were fit for war was consumed out of the
@c    camp, as the Lord had sworn:

@c    2:15. For his hand was against them, that they should perish from the
@c    midst of the camp.

@c    2:16. And after all the fighting men were dead,

@c    2:17. The Lord spoke to me, saying:

@c    2:18. Thou shalt pass this day the borders of Moab, the city named Ar:

@c    2:19. And when thou comest nigh the frontiers of the children of Ammon,
@c    take heed thou fight not against them, nor once move to battle:  for I
@c    will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon, because I have
@c    given it to the children of Lot for a possession.

@c    2:20. It was accounted a land of giants:  and giants formerly dwelt in
@c    it, whom the Ammonites call Zomzommims,

@c    2:21. A people great and many, and of tall stature, like the Enacims
@c    whom the Lord destroyed before their face:  and he made them to dwell in
@c    their stead,

@c    2:22. As he had done in favour of the children of Esau, that dwell in
@c    Seir, destroying the Horrhites, and delivering their land to them,
@c    which they possess to this day.

@c    2:23. The Hevites also, that dwelt in Haserim as far as Gaza, were
@c    expelled by the Cappadocians:  who came out of Cappadocia, and destroyed
@c    them and dwelt in their stead.

@c    2:24. Arise ye, and pass the torrent Arnon:  Behold I have delivered
@c    into thy hand Sehon king of Hesebon the Amorrhite, and begin thou to
@c    possess his land and make war against him.

@c    2:25. This day will I begin to send the dread and fear of thee upon the
@c    nations that dwell under the whole heaven:  that when they hear thy name
@c    they may fear and tremble, and be in pain like women in travail.

@c    2:26. So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Cademoth to Sehon the
@c    king of Hesebon with peaceable words, saying:

@c    2:27. We will pass through thy land, we will go along by the highway:
@c    we will not turn aside neither to the right hand nor to the left.

@c    2:28. Sell us meat for money, that we may eat:  give us water for money
@c    and so we will drink.  We only ask that thou wilt let us pass through,

@c    2:29. As the children of Esau have done, that dwell in Seir, and the
@c    Moabites, that abide in Ar:  until we come to the Jordan, and pass to
@c    the land which the Lord our God will give us.

@c    2:30. And Sehon the king of Hesebon would not let us pass:  because the
@c    Lord thy God had hardened his spirit, and fixed his heart, that he
@c    might be delivered into thy hands, as now thou seest.

@c    Hardened, etc. . .That is, in punishment of his past sins he left him to
@c    his own stubborn and perverse disposition, which drew him to his ruin.
@c    See the note on Ex. 7.3.

@c    2:31. And the Lord said to me:  Behold I have begun to deliver unto thee
@c    Sehon and his land, begin to possess it.

@c    2:32. And Sehon came out to meet us with all his people to fight at
@c    Jasa.

@c    2:33. And the Lord our God delivered him to us:  and we slew him with
@c    his sons and all his people.

@c    2:34. And we took all his cities at that time, killing the inhabitants
@c    of them, men and women and children.  We left nothing of them:

@c    2:35. Except the cattle which came to the share of them that took them:
@c    and the spoils of the cities, which we took:

@c    2:36. From Aroer, which is upon the bank of the torrent Arnon, a town
@c    that is situate in a valley, as far as Galaad.  There was not a village
@c    or city, that escaped our hands:  the Lord our God delivered all unto
@c    us:

@c    2:37. Except the land of the children of Ammon, to which we approached
@c    not:  and all that border upon the torrent Jeboc, and the cities in the
@c    mountains, and all the places which the Lord our God forbade us.



@c    Deuteronomy Chapter 3


@c    The victory over Og king of Basan.  Ruben, Gad, and half the tribe of
@c    Manasses receive their possession on the other side of Jordan.

@c    3:1. Then we turned and went by the way of Basan:  and Og the king of
@c    Basan came out to meet us with his people to fight in Edrai.

@c    3:2. And the Lord said to me:  Fear him not:  because he is delivered
@c    into thy hand, with all his people and his land:  and thou shalt do to
@c    him as thou hast done to Sehon king of the Amorrhites, that dwelt in
@c    Hesebon.

@c    3:3. So the Lord our God delivered into our hands, Og also, the king of
@c    Basan, and all his people:  and we utterly destroyed them,

@c    3:4. Wasting all his cities at one time, there was not a town that
@c    escaped us:  sixty cities, all the country of Argob the kingdom of Og in
@c    Basan.

@c    3:5. All the cities were fenced with very high walls, and with gates
@c    and bars, besides innumerable towns that had no walls.

@c    3:6. And we utterly destroyed them, as we had done to Sehon the king of
@c    Hesebon, destroying every city, men and women and children:

@c    3:7. But the cattle and the spoils of the cities we took for our prey.

@c    3:8. And we took at that time the land out of the hand of the two kings
@c    of the Amorrhites, that were beyond the Jordan:  from the torrent Arnon
@c    unto the mount Hermon,

@c    3:9. Which the Sidonians call Sarion, and the Amorrhites Sanir:

@c    3:10. All the cities that are situate in the plain, and all the land of
@c    Galaad and Basan as far as Selcha and Edrai, cities of the kingdom of
@c    Og in Basan.

@c    3:11. For only Og king of Basan remained of the race of the giants.  His
@c    bed of iron is shewn, which is in Rabbath of the children of Ammon,
@c    being nine cubits long, and four broad after the measure of the cubit
@c    of a man's hand.

@c    3:12. And we possessed the land at that time from Aroer, which is upon
@c    the bank of the torrent Arnon, unto the half of mount Galaad:  and I
@c    gave the cities thereof to Ruben and Gad.

@c    3:13. And I delivered the other part of Galaad, and all Basan the
@c    kingdom of Og to the half tribe of Manasses, all the country of Argob:
@c    and all Basan is called the Land of giants.

@c    3:14. Jair the son of Manasses possessed all the country of Argob unto
@c    the borders of Gessuri, and Machati.  And he called Basan by his own
@c    name, Havoth Jair, that is to say, the towns of Jair, until this
@c    present day.

@c    3:15. To Machir also I gave Galaad.

@c    3:16. And to the tribes of Ruben and Gad I gave of the land of Galaad
@c    as far as the torrent Arnon, half the torrent, and the confines even
@c    unto the torrent Jeboc, which is the border of the children of Ammon:

@c    3:17. And the plain of the wilderness, and the Jordan, and the borders
@c    of Cenereth unto the sea of the desert, which is the most salt sea, to
@c    the foot of mount Phasga eastward.

@c    3:18. And I commanded you at that time, saying:  The Lord your God
@c    giveth you this land for an inheritance, go ye well appointed before
@c    your brethren the children of Israel, all the strong men of you.

@c    3:19. Leaving your wives and children and cattle.  For I know you have
@c    much cattle, and they must remain in the cities, which I have delivered
@c    to you.

@c    3:20. Until the Lord give rest to your brethren, as he hath given to
@c    you:  and they also possess the land, which he will give them beyond the
@c    Jordan:  then shall every man return to his possession, which I have
@c    given you.

@c    3:21. I commanded Josue also at that time, saying:  Thy eyes have seen
@c    what the Lord your God hath done to these two kings:  so will he do to
@c    all the kingdoms to which thou shalt pass.

@c    3:22. Fear them not:  for the Lord your God will fight for you.

@c    3:23. And I besought the Lord at that time, saying:

@c    3:24. Lord God, thou hast begun to shew unto thy servant thy greatness,
@c    and most mighty hand, for there is no other God either in heaven or
@c    earth, that is able to do thy works, or to be compared to thy strength.

@c    3:25. I will pass over therefore, and will see this excellent land
@c    beyond the Jordan, and this goodly mountain, and Libanus.

@c    3:26. And the Lord was angry with me on your account and heard me not,
@c    but said to me:  It is enough:  speak no more to me of this matter.

@c    3:27. Go up to the top of Phasga, and cast thy eyes round about to the
@c    west, and to the north, and to the south, and to the east, and behold
@c    it, for thou shalt not pass this Jordan.

@c    3:28. Command Josue, and encourage and strengthen him:  for he shall go
@c    before this people, and shall divide unto them the land which thou
@c    shalt see.

@c    3:29. And we abode in the valley over against the temple of Phogor.



@c    Deuteronomy Chapter 4


@c    Moses exhorteth the people to keep God's commandments:  particularly to
@c    fly idolatry.  Appointeth three cities of refuge, on that side of the
@c    Jordan.

@c    4:1. And now, O Israel, hear the commandments and judgments which I
@c    teach thee:  that doing them, thou mayst live, and entering in mayst
@c    possess the land which the Lord the God of your fathers will give you.

@c    4:2. You shall not add to the word that I speak to you, neither shall
@c    you take away from it:  keep the commandments of the Lord your God which
@c    I command you.

@c    4:3. Your eyes have seen all that the Lord hath done against
@c    Beelphegor, how he hath destroyed all his worshippers from among you.

@c    4:4. But you that adhere to the Lord your God, are all alive until this
@c    present day.

@c    4:5. You know that I have taught you statutes and justices, as the Lord
@c    my God hath commanded me:  so shall you do them in the land which you
@c    shall possess:

@c    4:6. And you shall observe, and fulfil them in practice.  For this is
@c    your wisdom, and understanding in the sight of nations, that hearing
@c    all these precepts, they may say:  Behold a wise and understanding
@c    people, a great nation.

@c    4:7. Neither is there any other nation so great, that hath gods so nigh
@c    them, as our God is present to all our petitions.

@c    4:8. For what other nation is there so renowned that hath ceremonies,
@c    and just judgments, and all the law, which I will set forth this day
@c    before our eyes?

@c    4:9. Keep thyself therefore, and thy soul carefully.  Forget not the
@c    words that thy eyes have seen, and let them not go out of thy heart all
@c    the days of thy life.  Thou shalt teach them to thy sons and to thy
@c    grandsons,

@c    4:10. From the day in which thou didst stand before the Lord thy God in
@c    Horeb, when the Lord spoke to me, saying:  Call together the people unto
@c    me, that they may hear my words, and may learn to fear me all the time
@c    that they live on the earth, and may teach their children.

@c    4:11. And you came to the foot of the mount, which burned even unto
@c    heaven:  and there was darkness, and a cloud and obscurity in it.

@c    4:12. And the Lord spoke to you from the midst of the fire.  You heard
@c    the voice of his words, but you saw not any form at all.

@c    4:13. And he shewed you his covenant, which he commanded you to do, and
@c    the ten words that he wrote in two tables of stone.

@c    4:14. And he commanded me at that time that I should teach you the
@c    ceremonies and judgments which you shall do in the land, that you shall
@c    possess.

@c    4:15. Keep therefore your souls carefully.  You saw not any similitude
@c    in the day that the Lord God spoke to you in Horeb from the midst of
@c    the fire:

@c    4:16. Lest perhaps being deceived you might make you a graven
@c    similitude, or image of male or female,

@c    4:17. The similitude of any beasts, that are upon the earth, or of
@c    birds, that fly under heaven,

@c    4:18. Or of creeping things, that move on the earth, or of fishes, that
@c    abide in the waters under the earth:

@c    4:19. Lest perhaps lifting up thy eyes to heaven, thou see the sun and
@c    the moon, and all the stars of heaven, and being deceived by error thou
@c    adore and serve them, which the Lord thy God created for the service of
@c    all the nations, that are under heaven.

@c    4:20. But the Lord hath taken you and brought you out of the iron
@c    furnaces of Egypt, to make you his people of inheritance, as it is this
@c    present day.

@c    4:21. And the Lord was angry with me for your words, and he swore that
@c    I should not pass over the Jordan, nor enter into the excellent land,
@c    which he will give you.

@c    4:22. Behold I die in this land, I shall not pass over the Jordan:  you
@c    shall pass, and possess the goodly land.

@c    4:23. Beware lest thou ever forget the covenant of the Lord thy God,
@c    which he hath made with thee:  and make to thyself a graven likeness of
@c    those things which the Lord hath forbid to be made:

@c    4:24. Because the Lord thy God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.

@c    4:25. If you shall beget sons and grandsons, and abide in the land, and
@c    being deceived, make to yourselves any similitude, committing evil
@c    before the Lord your God, to provoke him to wrath:

@c    4:26. I call this day heaven and earth to witness, that you shall
@c    quickly perish out of the land, which, when you have passed over the
@c    Jordan, you shall possess.  You shall not dwell therein long, but the
@c    Lord will destroy you,

@c    4:27. And scatter you among all nations, and you shall remain a few
@c    among the nations, to which the Lord shall lead you.

@c    4:28. And there you shall serve gods, that were framed with men's
@c    hands:  wood and stone, that neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.

@c    4:29. And when thou shalt seek there the Lord thy God, thou shalt find
@c    him:  yet so, if thou seek him with all thy heart, and all the
@c    affliction of thy soul.

@c    4:30. After all the things aforesaid shall find thee, in the latter
@c    time thou shalt return to the Lord thy God, and shalt hear his voice.

@c    4:31. Because the Lord thy God is a merciful God:  he will not leave
@c    thee, nor altogether destroy thee, nor forget the covenant, by which he
@c    swore to thy fathers.

@c    4:32. Ask of the days of old, that have been before thy time from the
@c    day that God created man upon the earth, from one end of heaven to the
@c    other end thereof, if ever there was done the like thing, or it hath
@c    been known at any time,

@c    4:33. That a people should hear the voice of God speaking out of the
@c    midst of fire, as thou hast heard, and lived:

@c    4:34. If God ever did so as to go, and take to himself a nation out of
@c    the midst of nations by temptations, signs, and wonders, by fight, and
@c    a strong hand, and stretched out arm, and horrible visions according to
@c    all the things that the Lord your God did for you in Egypt, before thy
@c    eyes.

@c    4:35. That thou mightest know that the Lord he is God, and there is no
@c    other besides him.

@c    4:36. From heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might teach
@c    thee.  And upon earth he shewed thee his exceeding great fire, and thou
@c    didst hear his words out of the midst of the fire,

@c    4:37. Because he loved thy fathers, and chose their seed after them.
@c    And he brought thee out of Egypt, going before thee with his great
@c    power,

@c    4:38. To destroy at thy coming very great nations, and stronger than
@c    thou art, and to bring thee in, and give thee their land for a
@c    possession, as thou seest at this present day.

@c    4:39. Know therefore this day, and think in thy heart that the Lord he
@c    is God in heaven above, and in the earth beneath, and there is no
@c    other.

@c    4:40. Keep his precepts and commandments, which I command thee:  that it
@c    may be well with thee, and thy children after thee, and thou mayst
@c    remain a long time upon the land, which the Lord thy God will give
@c    thee.

@c    4:41. Then Moses set aside three cities beyond the Jordan at the east
@c    side,

@c    4:42. That any one might flee to them who should kill his neighbour
@c    unwillingly, and was not his enemy a day or two before, and that he
@c    might escape to some one of these cities:

@c    4:43. Bosor in the wilderness, which is situate in the plains of the
@c    tribe of Ruben:  and Ramoth in Galaad, which is in the tribe of Gad:  and
@c    Golan in Basan, which is in the tribe of Manasses.

@c    4:44. This is the law, that Moses set before the children of Israel,

@c    4:45. And these are the testimonies and ceremonies and judgments, which
@c    he spoke to the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt,

@c    4:46. Beyond the Jordan in the valley over against the temple of
@c    Phogor, in the land of Sehon king of the Amorrhites, that dwelt in
@c    Hesebon, whom Moses slew.  And the children of Israel coming out of
@c    Egypt,

@c    4:47. Possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Basan, of the two
@c    kings of the Amorrhites, who were beyond the Jordan towards the rising
@c    of the sun:

@c    4:48. From Aroer, which is situate upon the bank of the torrent Arnon,
@c    unto mount Sion, which is also called Hermon,

@c    4:49. All the plain beyond the Jordan at the east side, unto the sea of
@c    the wilderness, and unto the foot of mount Phasga.



@c    Deuteronomy Chapter 5


@c    The ten commandments are repeated and explained.

@c    5:1. And Moses called all Israel, and said to them:  Hear, O Israel, the
@c    ceremonies and judgments, which I speak in your ears this day:  learn
@c    them, and fulfil them in work.

@c    5:2. The Lord our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.

@c    5:3. He made not the covenant with our fathers, but with us, who are
@c    now present and living.

@c    5:4. He spoke to us face to face in the mount out of the midst of fire.

@c    5:5. I was the mediator and stood between the Lord and you at that
@c    time, to shew you his words, for you feared the fire, and went not up
@c    into the mountain, and he said:

@c    5:6. I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt,
@c    out of the house of bondage.

@c    5:7. Thou shalt not have strange gods in my sight.

@c    5:8. Thou shalt not make to thy self a graven thing, nor the likeness
@c    of any things, that are in heaven above, or that are in the earth
@c    beneath, or that abide in the waters under the earth.

@c    5:9. Thou shalt not adore them, and thou shalt not serve them.  For I am
@c    the Lord thy God, a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers
@c    upon their children unto the third and fourth generation, to them that
@c    hate me,

@c    5:10. And shewing mercy unto many thousands, to them that love me, and
@c    keep my commandments.

@c    5:11. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain:  for he
@c    shall not be unpunished that taketh his name upon a vain thing.

@c    5:12. Observe the day of the sabbath, to sanctify it, as the Lord thy
@c    God hath commanded thee.

@c    5:13. Six days shalt thou labour, and shalt do all thy works.

@c    5:14. The seventh is the day of the sabbath, that is, the rest of the
@c    Lord thy God.  Thou shalt not do any work therein, thou nor thy son nor
@c    thy daughter, nor thy manservant nor thy maidservant, nor thy ox, nor
@c    thy ass, nor any of thy beasts, nor the stranger that is within thy
@c    gates:  that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest, even as
@c    thyself.

@c    5:15. Remember that thou also didst serve in Egypt, and the Lord thy
@c    God brought thee out from thence with a strong hand, and a stretched
@c    out arm.  Therefore hath he commanded thee that thou shouldst observe
@c    the sabbath day.

@c    5:16. Honour thy father and mother, as the Lord thy God hath commanded
@c    thee, that thou mayst live a long time, and it may be well with thee in
@c    the land, which the Lord thy God will give thee.

@c    5:17. Thou shalt not kill.

@c    5:18. Neither shalt thou commit adultery.

@c    5:19. And thou shalt not steal.

@c    5:20. Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour.

@c    5:21. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife:  nor his house, nor his
@c    field, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his
@c    ass, nor any thing that is his.

@c    5:22. These words the Lord spoke to all the multitude of you in the
@c    mountain, out of the midst of the fire and the cloud, and the darkness,
@c    with a loud voice, adding nothing more:  and he wrote them in two tables
@c    of stone, which he delivered unto me.

@c    5:23. But you, after you heard the voice out of the midst of the
@c    darkness, and saw the mountain burn, came to me, all the princes of the
@c    tribes and the elders, and you said:

@c    5:24. Behold the Lord our God hath shewn us his majesty and his
@c    greatness, we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire, and
@c    have proved this day that God speaking with man, man hath lived.

@c    5:25. Why shall we die therefore, and why shall this exceeding great
@c    fire comsume us:  for if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any more,
@c    we shall die.

@c    5:26. What is all flesh, that it should hear the voice of the living
@c    God, who speaketh out of the midst of the fire, as we have heard, and
@c    be able to live?

@c    5:27. Approach thou rather:  and hear all things that the Lord our God
@c    shall say to thee, and thou shalt speak to us, and we will hear and
@c    will do them.

@c    5:28. And when the Lord had heard this, he said to me:  I have heard the
@c    voice of the words of this people, which they spoke to thee:  they have
@c    spoken all things well.

@c    5:29. Who shall give them to have such a mind, to fear me, and to keep
@c    all my commandments at all times, that it may be well with them and
@c    with their children for ever?

@c    5:30. Go and say to them:  Return into your tents.

@c    5:31. But stand thou here with me, and I will speak to thee all my
@c    commandments, and ceremonies and judgments:  which thou shalt teach
@c    them, that they may do them in the land, which I will give them for a
@c    possession.

@c    5:32. Keep therefore and do the things which the Lord God hath
@c    commanded you:  you shall not go aside neither to the right hand, nor to
@c    the left.

@c    5:33. But you shall walk in the way that the Lord your God hath
@c    commanded, that you may live, and it may be well with you, and your
@c    days may be long in the land of your possession.



@c    Deuteronomy Chapter 6


@c    An exhortation to the love of God, and obedience to his law.

@c    6:1. These are the precepts, and ceremonies, and judgments, which the
@c    Lord your God commanded that I should teach you, and that you should do
@c    them in the land into which you pass over to possess it:

@c    6:2. That thou mayst fear the Lord thy God, and keep all his
@c    commandments and precepts, which I command thee, and thy sons, and thy
@c    grandsons, all the days of thy life, that thy days may be prolonged.

@c    6:3. Hear, O Israel, and observe to do the things which the Lord hath
@c    commanded thee, that it may be well with thee, and thou mayst be
@c    greatly multiplied, as the Lord the God of thy fathers hath promised
@c    thee a land flowing with milk and honey.

@c    6:4. Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord.

@c    6:5. Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, and with
@c    thy whole soul, and with thy whole strength.

@c    6:6. And these words which I command thee this day, shall be in thy
@c    heart:
6:6. .i di'u poi mi ca minde ke'a do nenri le risna be ko
@c This of course implies that the words are blood. Does this make any sense,
@c even metaphorically?

@c    6:7. And thou shalt tell them to thy children, and thou shalt meditate
@c    upon them sitting in thy house, and walking on thy journey, sleeping
@c    and rising.
6:7. .ije di'u lisri fi le do panzi ko .ije ko pensi di'u calenu do zutse
nenri le zdani be do gi'a klama fo lo dargu gi'a sipna gi'a sanli
@c dargu? pluta? klaji?

@c    6:8. And thou shalt bind them as a sign on thy hand, and they shall be
@c    and shall move between thy eyes.
6:8. .i ko lasna di'u no'u lo sinxa le xance be do .i di'u mortci jbini
le kanla be do
@c mortci: "totafot" is replaced in a parallel passage with "zikharon".

@c    6:9. And thou shalt write them in the entry, and on the doors of thy
@c    house.

@c    6:10. And when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land,
@c    for which he swore to thy fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob:  and shall
@c    have given thee great and goodly cities, which thou didst not build,

@c    6:11. Houses full of riches, which thou didst not set up, cisterns
@c    which thou didst not dig, vineyards and oliveyards, which thou didst
@c    not plant,

@c    6:12. And thou shalt have eaten and be full:

@c    6:13. Take heed diligently lest thou forget the Lord, who brought thee
@c    out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.  Thou shalt fear
@c    the Lord thy God, and shalt serve him only, and thou shalt swear by his
@c    name.

@c    6:14. You shall not go after the strange gods of all the nations, that
@c    are round about you:

@c    6:15. Because the Lord thy God is a jealous God in the midst of thee:
@c    lest at any time the wrath of the Lord thy God be kindled against thee,
@c    and take thee away from the face of the earth.

@c    6:16. Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God, as thou temptedst him in
@c    the place of temptation.

@c    6:17. Keep the precepts of the Lord thy God, and the testimonies and
@c    ceremonies which he hath commanded thee.

@c    6:18. And do that which is pleasing and good in the sight of the Lord,
@c    that it may be well with thee:  and going in thou mayst possess the
@c    goodly land, concerning which the Lord swore to thy fathers,

@c    6:19. That he would destroy all thy enemies before thee, as he hath
@c    spoken.

@c    6:20. And when thy son shall ask thee to morrow, saying:  What mean
@c    these testimonies, and ceremonies and judgments, which the Lord our God
@c    hath commanded us?

@c    6:21. Thou shalt say to him:  We were bondmen of Pharao in Egypt, and
@c    the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a strong hand.

@c    6:22. And he wrought signs and wonders great and very grievous in Egypt
@c    against Pharao, and all his house, in our sight,

@c    6:23. And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in and
@c    give us the land, concerning which he swore to our fathers.

@c    6:24. And the Lord commanded that we should do all these ordinances,
@c    and should fear the Lord our God, that it might be well with us all the
@c    days of our life, as it is at this day.

@c    6:25. And he will be merciful to us, if we keep and do all his precepts
@c    before the Lord our God, as he hath commanded us.



@c    Deuteronomy Chapter 7


@c    No league nor fellowship to be made with the Chanaanites:  God promiseth
@c    his people his blessing and assistance, if they keep his commandments.

@c    7:1. When the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land, which
@c    thou art going in to possess, and shall have destroyed many nations
@c    before thee, the Hethite, and the Gergezite, and the Amorrhite, and the
@c    Chanaanite, and the Pherezite, and the Hevite, and the Jebusite, seven
@c    nations much more numerous than thou art, and stronger than thou:

@c    7:2. And the Lord thy God shall have delivered them to thee, thou shalt
@c    utterly destroy them.  Thou shalt make no league with them, nor shew
@c    mercy to them:

@c    7:3. Neither shalt thou make marriages with them.  Thou shalt not give
@c    thy daughter to his son, nor take his daughter for thy son:

@c    7:4. For she will turn away thy son from following me, that he may
@c    rather serve strange gods, and the wrath of the Lord will be kindled,
@c    and will quickly destroy thee.

@c    7:5. But thus rather shall you deal with them:  Destroy their altars,
@c    and break their statues, and cut down their groves, and burn their
@c    graven things.

@c    7:6. Because thou art a holy people to the Lord thy God.  The Lord thy
@c    God hath chosen thee, to be his peculiar people of all peoples that are
@c    upon the earth.

@c    7:7. Not because you surpass all nations in number, is the Lord joined
@c    unto you, and hath chosen you, for you are the fewest of any people:

@c    7:8. But because the Lord hath loved you, and hath kept his oath, which
@c    he swore to your fathers:  and hath brought you out with a strong hand,
@c    and redeemed you from the house of bondage, out of the hand of Pharao
@c    the king of Egypt.

@c    7:9. And thou shalt know that the Lord thy God, he is a strong and
@c    faithful God, keeping his covenant and mercy to them that love him, and
@c    to them that keep his commandments, unto a thousand generations:

@c    7:10. And repaying forthwith them that hate him, so as to destroy them,
@c    without further delay immediately rendering to them what they deserve.

@c    7:11. Keep therefore the precepts and ceremonies and judgments, which I
@c    command thee this day to do.

@c    7:12. If after thou hast heard these judgments, thou keep and do them,
@c    the Lord thy God will also keep his covenant to thee, and the mercy
@c    which he swore to thy fathers:

@c    7:13. And he will love thee and multiply thee, and will bless the fruit
@c    of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy vintage, thy
@c    oil, and thy herds, and the flocks of thy sheep upon the land, for
@c    which he swore to thy fathers that he would give it thee.

@c    7:14. Blessed shalt thou be among all people.  No one shall be barren
@c    among you of either sex, neither of men nor cattle.

@c    7:15. The Lord will take away from thee all sickness:  and the grievous
@c    infirmities of Egypt, which thou knowest, he will not bring upon thee,
@c    but upon thy enemies.

@c    7:16. Thou shalt consume all the people, which the Lord thy God will
@c    deliver to thee.  Thy eye shall not spare them, neither shalt thou serve
@c    their gods, lest they be thy ruin.

@c    7:17. If thou say in thy heart:  These nations are more than I, how
@c    shall I be able to destroy them?

@c    7:18. Fear not, but remember what the Lord thy God did to Pharao and to
@c    all the Egyptians,

@c    7:19. The exceeding great plagues, which thy eyes saw, and the signs
@c    and wonders, and the strong hand, and the stretched out arm, with which
@c    the Lord thy God brought thee out:  so will he do to all the people,
@c    whom thou fearest.

@c    7:20. Moreover the Lord thy God will send also hornets among them,
@c    until he destroy and consume all that have escaped thee, and could hide
@c    themselves.

@c    7:21. Thou shalt not fear them, because the Lord thy God is in the
@c    midst of thee, a God mighty and terrible:

@c    7:22. He will consume these nations in thy sight by little and little
@c    and by degrees.  Thou wilt not be able to destroy them altogether:  lest
@c    perhaps the beasts of the earth should increase upon thee.

@c    7:23. But the Lord thy God shall deliver them in thy sight:  and shall
@c    slay them until they be utterly destroyed.

@c    7:24. And he shall deliver their kings into thy hands, and thou shalt
@c    destroy their names from under Heaven:  no man shall be able to resist
@c    thee, until thou destroy them.

@c    7:25. Their graven things thou shalt burn with fire:  thou shalt not
@c    covet the silver and gold of which they are made, neither shalt thou
@c    take to thee any thing thereof, lest thou offend, because it is an
@c    abomination to the Lord thy God.

@c    Graven things. . .Idols, so called by contempt.

@c    7:26. Neither shalt thou bring any thing of the idol into thy house,
@c    lest thou become an anathema, like it.  Thou shalt detest it as dung,
@c    and shalt utterly abhor it as uncleanness and filth, because it is an
@c    anathema.



@c    Deuteronomy Chapter 8


@c    The people is put in mind of God's dealings with them, to the end that
@c    they may love him and serve him.

@c    8:1. All the commandments, that I command thee this day, take great
@c    care to observe:  that you may live, and be multiplied, and going in may
@c    possess the land, for which the Lord swore to your fathers.

@c    8:2. And thou shalt remember all the way through which the Lord thy God
@c    hath brought thee for forty years through the desert, to afflict thee
@c    and to prove thee, and that the things that were known in thy heart
@c    might be made known, whether thou wouldst keep his commandments or no.

@c    8:3. He afflicted thee with want, and gave thee manna for thy food,
@c    which neither thou nor thy fathers knew:  to shew that not in bread
@c    alone doth man live, but in every word that proceedeth from the mouth
@c    of God.

@c    Not in bread alone, etc. . .That is, that God is able to make food of
@c    what he pleases for the support of man.

@c    8:4. Thy raiment, with which thou wast covered, hath not decayed for
@c    age, and thy foot is not worn, lo this is the fortieth year,

@c    8:5. That thou mayst consider in thy heart, that as a man traineth up
@c    his son, so the Lord thy God hath trained thee up.

@c    8:6. That thou shouldst keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, and
@c    walk in his ways, and fear him.

@c    8:7. For the Lord thy God will bring thee into a good land, of brooks
@c    and of waters, and of fountains:  in the plains of which and the hills
@c    deep rivers break out:

@c    8:8. A land of wheat, and barley, and vineyards, wherein fig trees and
@c    pomegranates, and oliveyards grow:  a land of oil and honey.

@c    8:9. Where without any want thou shalt eat thy bread, and enjoy
@c    abundance of all things:  where the stones are iron, and out of its
@c    hills are dug mines of brass:

@c    8:10. That when thou hast eaten, and art full, thou mayst bless the
@c    Lord thy God for the excellent land which he hath given thee.

@c    8:11. Take heed, and beware lest at any time thou forget the Lord thy
@c    God, and neglect his commandments and judgments and ceremonies, which I
@c    command thee this day:

@c    8:12. Lest after thou hast eaten and art filled, hast built goodly
@c    houses, and dwelt in them,

@c    8:13. And shalt have herds of oxen and flocks of sheep, and plenty of
@c    gold and of silver, and of all things,

@c    8:14. Thy heart be lifted up, and thou remember not the Lord thy God,
@c    who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage:

@c    8:15. And was thy leader in the great and terrible wilderness, wherein
@c    there was the serpent burning with his breath, and the scorpion and the
@c    dipsas, and no waters at all:  who brought forth streams out of the
@c    hardest rock,

@c    The Dipsas. . .A serpent whose bite causeth a violent thirst; from
@c    whence it has its name, for in Greek dipsa signifies thirst.

@c    8:16. And fed thee in the wilderness with manna which thy fathers knew
@c    not.  And after he had afflicted and proved thee, at the last he had
@c    mercy on thee,

@c    8:17. Lest thou shouldst say in thy heart:  My own might, and the
@c    strength of my own hand have achieved all these things for me.

@c    8:18. But remember the Lord thy God, that he hath given thee strength,
@c    that he might fulfil his covenant, concerning which he swore to thy
@c    fathers, as this present day sheweth.

@c    8:19. But if thou forget the Lord thy God, and follow strange gods, and
@c    serve and adore them:  behold now I foretell thee that thou shalt
@c    utterly perish.

@c    8:20. As the nations, which the Lord destroyed at thy entrance, so
@c    shall you also perish, if you be disobedient to the voice of the Lord
@c    your God.



@c    Deuteronomy Chapter 9


@c    Lest they should impute their victories to their own merits, they are
@c    put in mind of their manifold rebellions and other sins, for which they
@c    should have been destroyed, but God spared them for his promise made to
@c    Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

@c    9:1. Hear, O Israel:  Thou shalt go over the Jordan this day; to possess
@c    nations very great, and stronger than thyself, cities great, and walled
@c    up to the sky,

@c    9:2. A people great and tall, the sons of the Enacims, whom thou hast
@c    seen, and heard of, against whom no man is able to stand.

@c    9:3. Thou shalt know therefore this day that the Lord thy God himself
@c    will pass over before thee, a devouring and consuming fire, to destroy
@c    and extirpate and bring them to nothing before thy face quickly, as he
@c    hath spoken to thee.

@c    9:4. Say not in thy heart, when the Lord thy God shall have destroyed
@c    them in thy sight:  For my justice hath the Lord brought me in to
@c    possess this land, whereas these nations are destroyed for their
@c    wickedness.

@c    9:5. For it is not for thy justices, and the uprightness of thy heart
@c    that thou shalt go in to possess their lands:  but because they have
@c    done wickedly, they are destroyed at thy coming in:  and that the Lord
@c    might accomplish his word, which he promised by oath to thy fathers
@c    Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

@c    9:6. Know therefore that the Lord thy God giveth thee not this
@c    excellent land in possession for thy justices, for thou art a very
@c    stiffnecked people.

@c    9:7. Remember, and forget not how thou provokedst the Lord thy God to
@c    wrath in the wilderness.  From the day that thou camest out of Egypt
@c    unto this place, thou hast always strove against the Lord.

@c    9:8. For in Horeb, also thou didst provoke him, and he was angry, and
@c    would have destroyed thee,

@c    9:9. When I went up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, the
@c    tables of the covenant which the Lord made with you:  and I continued in
@c    the mount forty days and nights, neither eating bread, nor drinking
@c    water.

@c    9:10. And the Lord gave me two tables of stone written with the finger
@c    of God, and containing all the words that he spoke to you in the mount
@c    from the midst of the fire, when the people were assembled together.

@c    9:11. And when forty days were passed, and as many nights, the Lord
@c    gave me the two tables of stone, the tables of the covenant,

@c    9:12. And said to me:  Arise, and go down from hence quickly:  for thy
@c    people, which thou hast brought out of Egypt, have quickly forsaken the
@c    way that thou hast shewn them, and have made to themselves a molten
@c    idol.

@c    9:13. And again the Lord said to me:  I see that this people is
@c    stiffnecked:

@c    9:14. Let me alone that I may destroy them, and abolish their name from
@c    under heaven, and set thee over a nation, that is greater and stronger
@c    than this.

@c    9:15. And when I came down from the burning mount, and held the two
@c    tables of the covenant with both hands,

@c    9:16. And saw that you had sinned against the Lord your God, and had
@c    made to yourselves a molten calf, and had quickly forsaken his way,
@c    which he had shewn you:

@c    9:17. I cast the tables out of my hands, and broke them in your sight.

@c    9:18. And I fell down before the Lord as before, forty days and nights
@c    neither eating bread, nor drinking water, for all your sins, which you
@c    had committed against the Lord, and had provoked him to wrath:

@c    9:19. For I feared his indignation and anger, wherewith being moved
@c    against you, he would have destroyed you.  And the Lord heard me this
@c    time also.

@c    9:20. And he was exceeding angry against Aaron also, and would have
@c    destroyed him, and I prayed in like manner for him.

@c    9:21. And your sin that you had committed, that is, the calf, I took,
@c    and burned it with fire, and breaking it into pieces, until it was as
@c    small as dust, I threw it into the torrent, which cometh down from the
@c    mountain.

@c    9:22. At the burning also, and at the place of temptation, and at the
@c    graves of lust you provoked the Lord:

@c    9:23. And when he sent you from Cadesbarne, saying:  Go up, and possess
@c    the land that I have given you, and you slighted the commandment of the
@c    Lord your God, and did not believe him, neither would you hearken to
@c    his voice:

@c    9:24. But were always rebellious from the day that I began to know you.

@c    9:25. And I lay prostrate before the Lord forty days and nights, in
@c    which I humbly besought him, that he would not destroy you as he had
@c    threatened:

@c    9:26. And praying, I said:  O Lord God, destroy not thy people, and thy
@c    inheritance, which thou hast redeemed in thy greatness, whom thou hast
@c    brought out of Egypt with a strong hand.

@c    9:27. Remember thy servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob:  look not on the
@c    stubbornness of this people, nor on their wickedness and sin:

@c    9:28. Lest perhaps the inhabitants of the land, out of which thou hast
@c    brought us, say:  The Lord could not bring them into the land that he
@c    promised them, and he hated them:  therefore he brought them out, that
@c    he might kill them in the wilderness,

@c    9:29. Who are thy people and thy inheritance, whom thou hast brought
@c    out by thy great strength, and in thy stretched out arm.



@c    Deuteronomy Chapter 10


@c    God giveth the second tables of the law:  a further exhortation to fear
@c    and serve the Lord.

@c    10:1. At that time the Lord said to me:  Hew thee two tables of stone
@c    like the former, and come up to me into the mount:  and thou shalt make
@c    an ark of wood,

@c    10:2. And I will write on the tables the words that were in them, which
@c    thou brokest before, and thou shalt put them in the ark.

@c    10:3. And I made an ark of setim wood.  And when I had hewn two tables
@c    of stone like the former, I went up into the mount, having them in my
@c    hands.

@c    10:4. And he wrote in the tables, according as he had written before,
@c    the ten words, which the Lord spoke to you in the mount from the midst
@c    of the fire, when the people were assembled:  and he gave them to me.

@c    10:5. And returning from the mount, I came down, and put the tables
@c    into the ark, that I had made, and they are there till this present, as
@c    the Lord commanded me.

@c    10:6. And the children of Israel removed their camp from Beroth, of the
@c    children of Jacan into Mosera, where Aaron died and was buried, and
@c    Eleazar his son succeeded him in the priestly office.

@c    Mosera. . .By mount Hor, for there Aaron died, Num. 20. This and the
@c    following verses seem to be inserted by way of parenthesis.

@c    10:7. From thence they came to Gadgad, from which place they departed,
@c    and camped in Jetebatha, in a land of waters and torrents.

@c    10:8. At that time he separated the tribe of Levi, to carry the ark of
@c    the covenant of the Lord, and to stand before him in the ministry, and
@c    to bless in his name until this present day.

@c    10:9. Wherefore Levi hath no part nor possession with his brethren:
@c    because the Lord himself is his possession, as the Lord thy God
@c    promised him.

@c    10:10. And I stood in the mount, as before, forty days and nights:  and
@c    the Lord heard me this time also, and would not destroy thee.

@c    10:11. And he said to me:  Go, and walk before the people, that they may
@c    enter, and possess the land, which I swore to their fathers that I
@c    would give them.

@c    10:12. And now, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but
@c    that thou fear the Lord thy God, and walk in his ways, and love him,
@c    and serve the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul:

@c    10:13. And keep the commandments of the Lord, and his ceremonies, which
@c    I command thee this day, that it may be well with thee?

@c    10:14. Behold heaven is the Lord's thy God, and the heaven of heaven,
@c    the earth and all things that are therein.

@c    10:15. And yet the Lord hath been closely joined to thy fathers, and
@c    loved them and chose their seed after them, that is to say, you, out of
@c    all nations, as this day it is proved.

@c    10:16. Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and stiffen
@c    your neck no more.

@c    10:17. Because the Lord your God he is the God of gods, and the Lord of
@c    lords, a great God and mighty and terrible, who accepteth no person nor
@c    taketh bribes.

@c    10:18. He doth judgment to the fatherless and the widow, loveth the
@c    stranger, and giveth him food and raiment.

@c    10:19. And do you therefore love strangers, because you also were
@c    strangers in the land of Egypt.

@c    10:20. Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and serve him only:  to him
@c    thou shalt adhere, and shalt swear by his name.

@c    10:21. He is thy praise, and thy God, that hath done for thee these
@c    great and terrible things, which thy eyes have seen.

@c    10:22. In seventy souls thy fathers went down into Egypt:  and behold
@c    now the Lord thy God hath multiplied thee as the stars of heaven.



@c    Deuteronomy Chapter 11


@c    The love and service of God are still inculcated, with a blessing to
@c    them that serve him, and threats of punishment if they forsake his law.

@c    11:1. Therefore love the Lord thy God and observe his precepts and
@c    ceremonies, his judgments and commandments at all times.

@c    11:2. Know this day the things that your children know not, who saw not
@c    the chastisements of the Lord your God, his great doings and strong
@c    hand, and stretched out arm,

@c    11:3. The signs and works which he did in the midst of Egypt to king
@c    Pharao, and to all his land,

@c    11:4. And to all the host of the Egyptians, and to their horses and
@c    chariots:  how the waters of the Red Sea covered them, when they pursued
@c    you, and how the Lord destroyed them until this present day:

@c    11:5. And what he hath done to you in the wilderness, til you came to
@c    this place:

@c    11:6. And to Dathan and Abiron the sons of Eliab, who was the son of
@c    Ruben:  whom the earth, opening her mouth swallowed up with their
@c    households and tents, and all their substance, which they had in the
@c    midst of Israel.

@c    11:7. Your eyes have seen all the great works of the Lord, that he hath
@c    done,

@c    11:8. That you may keep all his commandments, which I command you this
@c    day, and may go in, and possess the land, to which you are entering,

@c    11:9. And may live in it a long time:  which the Lord promised by oath
@c    to your fathers, and to their seed, a land which floweth with milk and
@c    honey.

@c    11:10. For the land, which thou goest to possess, is not like the land
@c    of Egypt, from whence thou camest out, where, when the seed is sown,
@c    waters are brought in to water it after the manner of gardens.

@c    11:11. But it is a land of hills and plains, expecting rain from
@c    heaven.

@c    11:12. And the Lord thy God doth always visit it, and his eyes are on
@c    it from the beginning of the year unto the end thereof.

@c    11:13. If then you obey my commandments, which I command you this day,
@c    that you love the Lord your God, and serve him with all your heart, and
@c    with all your soul:

@c    11:14. He will give to your land the early rain and the latter rain,
@c    that you may gather in your corn, and your wine, and your oil,

@c    11:15. And your hay out of the fields to feed your cattle, and that you
@c    may eat and be filled.

@c    11:16. Beware lest perhaps your heart be deceived, and you depart from
@c    the Lord, and serve strange gods, and adore them:

@c    11:17. And the Lord being angry shut up heaven, that the rain come not
@c    down, nor the earth yield her fruit, and you perish quickly from the
@c    excellent land, which the Lord will give you.

@c    11:18. Lay up these words in your hearts and minds, and hang them for a
@c    sign on your hands, and place them between your eyes.

@c    11:19. Teach your children that they meditate on them, when thou
@c    sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest on the way, and when thou
@c    liest down and risest up.

@c    11:20. Thou shalt write them upon the posts and the doors of thy house:

@c    11:21. That thy days may be multiplied, and the days of thy children in
@c    the land which the Lord swore to thy fathers, that he would give them
@c    as long as the heaven hangeth over the earth.

@c    11:22. For if you keep the commandments which I command you, and do
@c    them, to love the Lord your God, and walk in all his ways, cleaving
@c    unto him,

@c    11:23. The Lord will destroy all these nations before your face, and
@c    you shall possess them, which are greater and stronger than you.

@c    11:24. Every place, that your foot shall tread upon, shall be yours.
@c    From the desert, and from Libanus, from the great river Euphrates unto
@c    the western sea shall be your borders.

@c    11:25. None shall stand against you:  the Lord your God shall lay the
@c    dread and fear of you upon all the land that you shall tread upon, as
@c    he hath spoken to you.

@c    11:26. Behold I set forth in your sight this day a blessing and a
@c    curse:

@c    11:27. A blessing, if you obey the commandments of the Lord your God,
@c    which I command you this day:

@c    11:28. A curse, if you obey not the commandments of the Lord your God,
@c    but revolt from the way which now I shew you, and walk after strange
@c    gods which you know not.

@c    11:29. And when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land,
@c    whither thou goest to dwell, thou shalt put the blessing upon mount
@c    Garizim, the curse upon mount Hebal:

@c    Put the blessing, et. . .See Deut. 27.12, etc. and Josue 8.33, etc.

@c    11:30. Which are beyond the Jordan, behind the way that goeth to the
@c    setting of the sun, in the land of the Chanaanite who dwelleth in the
@c    plain country over against Galgala, which is near the valley that
@c    reacheth and entereth far.

@c    11:31. For you shall pass over the Jordan, to possess the land, which
@c    the Lord your God will give you, that you may have it and possess it.

@c    11:32. See therefore that you fulfil the ceremonies and judgments,
@c    which I shall set this day before you.



@c    Deuteronomy Chapter 12


@c    All idolatry must be extirpated:  sacrifices, tithes, and firstfruits
@c    must be offered in one only place:  all eating of blood is prohibited.

@c    12:1. These are the precepts and judgments, that you must do in the
@c    land, which the Lord the God of thy fathers will give thee, to possess
@c    it all the days that thou shalt walk upon the earth.

@c    12:2. Destroy all the places in which the nations, that you shall
@c    possess, worshipped their gods upon high mountains, and hills, and
@c    under every shady tree:

@c    12:3. Overthrow their altars, and break down their statues, burn their
@c    groves with fire, and break their idols in pieces:  destroy their names
@c    out of those places.

@c    12:4. You shall not do so to the Lord your God:

@c    12:5. But you shall come to the place, which the Lord your God shall
@c    choose out of all your tribes, to put his name there, and to dwell in
@c    it:

@c    12:6. And you shall offer in that place your holocausts and victims,
@c    the tithes and firstfruits of your hands and your vows and gifts, the
@c    firstborn of your herds and your sheep.

@c    12:7. And you shall eat there in the sight of the Lord your God:  and
@c    you shall rejoice in all things, whereunto you shall put your hand, you
@c    and your houses wherein the Lord your God hath blessed you.

@c    12:8. You shall not do there the things we do here this day, every man
@c    that which seemeth good to himself.

@c    12:9. For until this present time you are not come to rest, and to the
@c    possession, which the Lord your God will give you.

@c    12:10. You shall pass over the Jordan, and shall dwell in the land
@c    which the Lord your God will give you, that you may have rest from all
@c    enemies round about:  and may dwell without any fear,

@c    12:11. In the place, which the Lord your God shall choose, that his
@c    name may be therein.  Thither shall you bring all the things that I
@c    command you, holocausts, and victims, and tithes, and the firstfruits
@c    of your hands:  and whatsoever is the choicest in the gifts which you
@c    shall vow to the Lord.

@c    12:12. There shall you feast before the Lord your God, you and your
@c    sons and your daughters, your menservants and maidservants, and the
@c    Levite that dwelleth in your cities.  For he hath no other part and
@c    possession among you.

@c    12:13. Beware lest thou offer thy holocausts in every place that thou
@c    shalt see:

@c    12:14. But in the place which the Lord shall choose in one of thy
@c    tribes shalt thou offer sacrifices, and shalt do all that I command
@c    thee.

@c    12:15. But if thou desirest to eat, and the eating of flesh delight
@c    thee, kill, and eat according to the blessing of the Lord thy God,
@c    which he hath given thee, in thy cities:  whether it be unclean, that is
@c    to say, having blemish or defect:  or clean, that is to say, sound and
@c    without blemish, such as may be offered, as the roe, and the hart,
@c    shalt thou eat it:

@c    12:16. Only the blood thou shalt not eat, but thou shalt pour it out
@c    upon the earth as water.

@c    12:17. Thou mayst not eat in thy towns the tithes of thy corn, and thy
@c    wine, and thy oil, the firstborn of thy herds and thy cattle, nor any
@c    thing that thou vowest, and that thou wilt offer voluntarily, and the
@c    firstfruits of thy hands:

@c    12:18. But thou shalt eat them before the Lord thy God in the place
@c    which the Lord thy God shall choose, thou and thy son and thy daughter,
@c    and thy manservant, and maidservant, and the Levite that dwelleth in
@c    thy cities:  and thou shalt rejoice and be refreshed before the Lord thy
@c    God in all things, whereunto thou shalt put thy hand.

@c    12:19. Take heed thou forsake not the Levite all the time that thou
@c    livest in the land.

@c    12:20. When the Lord thy God shall have enlarged thy borders, as he hath
@c    spoken to thee, and thou wilt eat the flesh that thy soul desireth:

@c    12:21. And if the place which the Lord thy God shall choose, that his
@c    name should be there, be far off, thou shalt kill of thy herds and of
@c    thy flocks, as I have commanded thee, and shalt eat in thy towns, as it
@c    pleaseth thee.

@c    12:22. Even as the roe and the hart is eaten, so shalt thou eat them:
@c    both the clean and unclean shall eat of them alike.

@c    12:23. Only beware of this, that thou eat not the blood, for the blood
@c    is for the soul:  and therefore thou must not eat the soul with the
@c    flesh:

@c    12:24. But thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water,

@c    12:25. That it may be well with thee and thy children after thee, when
@c    thou shalt do that which is pleasing in the sight of the Lord.

@c    12:26. But the things which thou hast sanctified and vowed to the Lord,
@c    thou shalt take, and shalt come to the place which the Lord shall
@c    choose:

@c    12:27. And shalt offer thy oblations, the flesh and the blood upon the
@c    altar of the Lord thy God:  the blood of thy victims thou shalt pour on
@c    the altar:  and the flesh thou thyself shalt eat.

@c    12:28. Observe and hear all the things that I command thee, that it may
@c    be well with thee and thy children after thee for ever, when thou shalt
@c    do what is good and pleasing in the sight of the Lord thy God.

@c    12:29. When the Lord thy God shall have destroyed before thy face the
@c    nations, which thou shalt go in to possess, and when thou shalt possess
@c    them, and dwell in their land:

@c    12:30. Beware lest thou imitate them, after they are destroyed at thy
@c    coming in, and lest thou seek after their ceremonies, saying:  As these
@c    nations have worshipped their gods, so will I also worship.

@c    12:31. Thou shalt not do in like manner to the Lord thy God.  For they
@c    have done to their gods all the abominations which the Lord abhorreth,
@c    offering their sons and daughters, and burning them with fire.

@c    12:32. What I command thee, that only do thou to the Lord:  neither add
@c    any thing, nor diminish.

@c    That only do thou, etc. . .They are forbid here to follow the ceremonies
@c    of the heathens; or to make any alterations in the divine ordinances.



@c    Deuteronomy Chapter 13


@c    False prophets must be slain, and idolatrous cities destroyed.

@c    13:1. If there rise in the midst of thee a prophet or one that saith he
@c    hath dreamed a dream, and he foretell a sign and a wonder,

@c    13:2. And that come to pass which he spoke, and he say to thee:  Let us
@c    go and follow strange gods, which thou knowest not, and let us serve
@c    them:

@c    13:3. Thou shalt not hear the words of that prophet or dreamer:  for the
@c    Lord your God trieth you, that it may appear whether you love him with
@c    all your heart, and with all your soul, or not.

@c    13:4. Follow the Lord your God, and fear him, and keep his
@c    commandments, and hear his voice:  him you shall serve, and to him you
@c    shall cleave.

@c    13:5. And that prophet or forger of dreams shall be slain:  because he
@c    spoke to draw you away from the Lord your God, who brought you out of
@c    the land of Egypt, and redeemed you from the house of bondage:  to make
@c    thee go out of the way, which the Lord thy God commanded thee:  and thou
@c    shalt take away the evil out of the midst of thee.

@c    13:6. If thy brother the son of thy mother, or thy son, or daughter, or
@c    thy wife that is in thy bosom, or thy friend, whom thou lovest as thy
@c    own soul, would persuade thee secretly, saying:  Let us go, and serve
@c    strange gods, which thou knowest not, nor thy fathers,

@c    13:7. Of all the nations round about, that are near or afar off, from
@c    one end of the earth to the other,

@c    13:8. Consent not to him, hear him not, neither let thy eye spare him
@c    to pity and conceal him,

@c    13:9. But thou shalt presently put him to death.  Let thy hand be first
@c    upon him, and afterwards the hands of all the people.

@c    Presently put him to death. . .Not by killing him by private authority,
@c    but by informing the magistrate, and proceeding by order of justice.

@c    13:10. With stones shall he be stoned to death:  because he would have
@c    withdrawn thee from the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land
@c    of Egypt, from the house of bondage:

@c    13:11. That all Israel hearing may fear, and may do no more any thing
@c    like this.

@c    13:12. If in one of thy cities, which the Lord thy God shall give thee
@c    to dwell in, thou hear some say:

@c    13:13. Children of Belial are gone out of the midst of thee, and have
@c    withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, and have said:  Let us go, and
@c    serve strange gods which you know not:

@c    Belial. . .That is, without yoke.  Hence the wicked, who refuse to be
@c    subject to the divine law, are called in scripture the children of
@c    Belial.

@c    13:14. Inquire carefully and diligently, the truth of the thing by
@c    looking well into it, and if thou find that which is said to be
@c    certain, and that this abomination hath been really committed,

@c    13:15. Thou shalt forthwith kill the inhabitants of that city with the
@c    edge of the sword, and shalt destroy it and all things that are in it,
@c    even the cattle.

@c    13:16. And all the household goods that are there, thou shalt gather
@c    together in the midst of the streets thereof, and shall burn them with
@c    the city itself, so as to comsume all for the Lord thy God, and that it
@c    be a heap for ever:  it shall be built no more.

@c    13:17. And there shall nothing of that anathema stick to thy hand:  that
@c    the Lord may turn from the wrath of his fury, and may have mercy on
@c    thee, and multiply thee as he swore to thy fathers,

@c    13:18. When thou shalt hear the voice of the Lord thy God, keeping all
@c    his precepts, which I command thee this day, that thou mayst do what is
@c    pleasing in the sight of the Lord thy God.



@c    Deuteronomy Chapter 14


@c    In mourning for the dead they are not to follow the ways of the
@c    Gentiles:  the distinction of clean and unclean meats:  ordinances
@c    concerning tithes, and firstfruits.

@c    14:1. Be ye children of the Lord your God:  you shall not cut
@c    yourselves, nor make any baldness for the dead;

@c    14:2. Because thou art a holy people to the Lord thy God:  and he chose
@c    thee to be his peculiar people of all nations that are upon the earth.

@c    14:3. Eat not the things that are unclean.

@c    Unclean. . .See the annotations on Lev. 11.

@c    14:7. But of them that chew the cud, but divide not the hoof, you shall
@c    not eat, such as the camel, the hare, and the cherogril:  because they
@c    chew the cud, but divide not the hoof, they shall be unclean to you.

@c    14:8. The swine also, because it divideth the hoof, but cheweth not the
@c    cud, shall be unclean, their flesh you shall not eat, and their
@c    carcasses you shall not touch.

@c    14:9. These shall you eat of all that abide in the waters:  All that
@c    have fins and scales, you shall eat.

@c    14:10. Such as are without fins and scales, you shall not eat, because
@c    they are unclean.

14:11. ni'o ro cipni poi jinsa zo'u do citka

@c    unclean, and shall not be eaten.

@c    14:20. All that is clean, you shall eat.

@c    14:21. But whatsoever is dead of itself, eat not thereof.  Give it to
@c    the stranger, that is within thy gates, to eat, or sell it to him:
@c    because thou art the holy people of the Lord thy God.  Thou shalt not
@c    boil a kid in the milk of his dam.

@c    14:22. Every year thou shalt set aside the tithes of all thy fruits
@c    that the earth bringeth forth,

@c    14:23. And thou shalt eat before the Lord thy God in the place which he
@c    shall choose, that his name may be called upon therein, the tithe of
@c    thy corn, and thy wine, and thy oil, and the firstborn of thy herds and
@c    thy sheep:  that thou mayst learn to fear the Lord thy God at all times.

@c    14:24. But when the way and the place which the Lord thy God shall
@c    choose, are far off, and he hath blessed thee, and thou canst not carry
@c    all these things thither,

@c    14:25. Thou shalt sell them all, and turn them into money, and shalt
@c    carry it in thy hand, and shalt go to the place which the Lord shall
@c    choose:

@c    14:26. And thou shalt buy with the same money whatsoever pleaseth thee,
@c    either of the herds or of sheep, wine also and strong drink, and all
@c    that thy soul desireth:  and thou shalt eat before the Lord thy God, and
@c    shalt feast, thou and thy house:

@c    14:27. And the Levite that is within thy gates, beware thou forsake him
@c    not, because he hath no other part in thy possession.

@c    that grow to thee at that time, and shalt lay it up within thy gates.

@c    14:29. And the Levite that hath no other part nor possession with thee,
@c    and the stranger and the fatherless and the widow, that are within thy
@c    gates, shall come and shall eat and be filled:  that the Lord thy God
@c    may bless thee in all the works of thy hands that thou shalt do.



@c    Deuteronomy Chapter 15


@c    The law of the seventh year of remission.  The firstlings of cattle are
@c    to be sanctified to the Lord.

@c    15:1. In the seventh year thou shalt make a remission,

@c    15:2. Which shall be celebrated in this order.  He to whom any thing is
@c    owing from his friend or neighbour or brother, cannot demand it again,
@c    because it is the year of remission of the Lord.

@c    15:3. Of the foreigner or stranger thou mayst exact it:  of thy
@c    countryman and neighbour thou shalt not have power to demand it again.

@c    15:4. And there shall be no poor nor beggar among you:  that the Lord
@c    thy God may bless thee in the land which he will give thee in
@c    possession.

@c    There shall be no poor, etc. . .It is not to be understood as a promise,
@c    that there should be no poor in Israel, as appears from ver. 11, where
@c    we learn that God's people would never be at a loss to find objects for
@c    their charity:  but it is an ordinance that all should do their best
@c    endeavours to prevent any of their brethren from suffering the
@c    hardships of poverty and want.

@c    15:5. Yet so if thou hear the voice of the Lord thy God, and keep all
@c    things that he hath ordained, and which I command thee this day, he
@c    will bless thee, as he hath promised.

@c    15:6. Thou shalt lend to many nations, and thou shalt borrow of no man.
@c    Thou shalt have dominion over very many nations, and no one shall have
@c    dominion over thee.

@c    15:7. If one of thy brethren that dwelleth within thy gates of thy city
@c    in the land which the Lord thy God will give thee, come to poverty:
@c    thou shalt not harden thy heart, nor close thy hand,

@c    15:8. But shalt open it to the poor man, thou shalt lend him, that
@c    which thou perceivest he hath need of.

@c    15:9. Beware lest perhaps a wicked thought steal in upon thee, and thou
@c    say in thy heart:  The seventh year of remission draweth nigh; and thou
@c    turn away thy eyes from thy poor brother, denying to lend him that
@c    which he asketh:  lest he cry against thee to the Lord, and it become a
@c    sin unto thee.

@c    15:10. But thou shalt give to him:  neither shalt thou do any thing
@c    craftily in relieving his necessities:  that the Lord thy God may bless
@c    thee at all times, and in all things to which thou shalt put thy hand.

@c    15:11. There will not be wanting poor in the land of thy habitation:
@c    therefore I command thee to open thy hand to thy needy and poor
@c    brother, that liveth in the land.

@c    15:12. When thy brother a Hebrew man, or Hebrew woman is sold to thee,
@c    and hath served thee six years, in the seventh year thou shalt let him
@c    go free:

@c    15:13. And when thou sendest him out free, thou shalt not let him go
@c    away empty:

@c    15:14. But shall give him for his way out of thy flocks, and out of thy
@c    barnfloor, and thy winepress, wherewith the Lord thy God shall bless
@c    thee.

@c    15:15. Remember that thou also wast a bondservant in the land of Egypt,
@c    and the Lord thy God made thee free, and therefore I now command thee
@c    this.

@c    15:16. But if he say:  I will not depart:  because he loveth thee, and
@c    thy house, and findeth that he is well with thee:

@c    15:17. Thou shalt take an awl, and bore through his ear in the door of
@c    thy house, and he shall serve thee for ever:  thou shalt do in like
@c    manner to thy womanservant also.

@c    15:18. Turn not away thy eyes from them when thou makest them free:
@c    because he hath served thee six years according to the wages of a
@c    hireling:  that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all the works that
@c    thou dost.

@c    15:19. Of the firstlings, that come of thy herds and thy sheep, thou
@c    shalt sanctify to the Lord thy God whatsoever is of the male sex.  Thou
@c    shalt not work with the firstling of a bullock, and thou shalt not
@c    shear the firstlings of thy sheep.

@c    15:20. In the sight of the Lord thy God shalt thou eat them every year,
@c    in the place that the Lord shall choose, thou and thy house.

@c    15:21. But if it have a blemish, or be lame, or blind, or in any part
@c    disfigured or feeble, it shall not be sacrificed to the Lord thy God.

@c    15:22. But thou shalt eat it within the gates of thy city:  the clean
@c    and the unclean shall eat them alike, as the roe and as the hart.

@c    15:23. Only thou shalt take heed not to eat their blood, but pour it
@c    out on the earth as water.



@c    Deuteronomy Chapter 16


@c    The three principal solemnities to be observed:  just judges to be
@c    appointed in every city:  all occasions of idolatry to be avoided.

@c    16:1. Observe the month of new corn, which is the first of the spring,
@c    that thou mayst celebrate the phase to the Lord thy God:  because in
@c    this month the Lord thy God brought thee out of Egypt by night.

@c    16:2. And thou shalt sacrifice the phase to the Lord thy God, of sheep,
@c    and of oxen, in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose, that his
@c    name may dwell there.

@c    16:3. Thou shalt not eat with it leavened bread:  seven days shalt thou
@c    eat without leaven, the bread of affliction, because thou camest out of
@c    Egypt in fear:  that thou mayst remember the day of thy coming out of
@c    Egypt, all the days of thy life.

@c    16:4. No leaven shall be seen in all thy coasts for seven days, neither
@c    shall any of the flesh of that which was sacrificed the first day in
@c    the evening remain until morning.

@c    16:5. Thou mayst not immolate the phase in any one of thy cities, which
@c    the Lord thy God will give thee:

@c    16:6. But in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose, that his
@c    name may dwell there:  thou shalt immolate the phase in the evening, at
@c    the going down of the sun, at which time thou camest out of Egypt.

@c    16:7. And thou shalt dress, and eat it in the place which the Lord thy
@c    God shall choose, and in the morning rising up thou shalt go into thy
@c    dwellings.

@c    16:8. Six days shalt thou eat unleavened bread:  and on the seventh day,
@c    because it is the assembly of the Lord thy God, thou shalt do no work.

@c    16:9. Thou shalt number unto thee seven weeks from that day, wherein
@c    thou didst put the sickle to the corn.

@c    16:10. And thou shalt celebrate the festival of weeks to the Lord thy
@c    God, a voluntary oblation of thy hand, which thou shalt offer according
@c    to the blessing of the Lord thy God.

@c    16:11. And thou shalt feast before the Lord thy God, thou, and thy son,
@c    and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the
@c    Levite that is within thy gates, and the stranger and the fatherless,
@c    and the widow, who abide with you:  in the place which the Lord thy God
@c    shall choose, that his name may dwell there:

@c    16:12. And thou shalt remember that thou wast a servant in Egypt:  and
@c    thou shalt keep and do the things that are commanded.

@c    16:13. Thou shalt celebrate the solemnity also of tabernacles seven
@c    days, when thou hast gathered in thy fruit of the barnfloor and of the
@c    winepress.

@c    16:14. And thou shalt make merry in thy festival time, thou, thy son,
@c    and thy daughter, thy manservant, and thy maidservant, the Levite also
@c    and the stranger, and the fatherless and the widow that are within thy
@c    gates.

@c    16:15. Seven days shalt thou celebrate feasts to the Lord thy God in
@c    the place which the Lord shall choose:  and the Lord thy God will bless
@c    thee in all thy fruits, and in every work of thy hands, and thou shalt
@c    be in joy.

@c    16:16. Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the Lord
@c    thy God in the place which he shall choose:  in the feast of unleavened
@c    bread, in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles.  No one
@c    shall appear with his hands empty before the Lord:

@c    16:17. But every one shall offer according to what he hath, according
@c    to the blessing of the Lord his God, which he shall give him.

@c    16:18. Thou shalt appoint judges and magistrates in all thy gates,
@c    which the Lord thy God shall give thee, in all thy tribes:  that they
@c    may judge the people with just judgment,

@c    16:19. And not go aside to either part.  Thou shalt not accept person
@c    nor gifts:  for gifts blind the eyes of the wise, and change the words
@c    of the just.

@c    16:20. Thou shalt follow justly after that which is just:  that thou
@c    mayst live and possess the land, which the Lord thy God shall give
@c    thee.

@c    16:21. Thou shalt plant no grove, nor any tree near the altar of the
@c    Lord thy God:

@c    16:22. Neither shalt thou make nor set up to thyself a statue:  which
@c    things the Lord thy God hateth.



@c    Deuteronomy Chapter 17


@c    Victims must be without blemish.  Idolaters are to be slain.
@c    Controversies are to be decided by the high priest and council, whose
@c    sentence must be obeyed under pain of death.  The duty of a king, who is
@c    to receive the law of God at the priest's hands.

@c    17:1. Thou shalt not sacrifice to the Lord thy God a sheep, or an ox,
@c    wherein there is blemish, or any fault:  for that is an abomination to
@c    the Lord thy God.

@c    17:2. When there shall be found among you within any of thy gates,
@c    which the Lord thy God shall give thee, man or woman that do evil in
@c    the sight of the Lord thy God, and transgress his covenant,

@c    17:3. So as to go and serve strange gods, and adore them, the sun and
@c    the moon, and all the host of heaven, which I have not commanded:

@c    The host of heaven. . .That is, the stars.

@c    17:4. And this is told thee, and hearing it thou hast inquired
@c    diligently, and found it to be true, and that the abomination is
@c    committed in Israel:

@c    17:5. Thou shalt bring forth the man or the woman, who have committed
@c    that most wicked thing, to the gates of thy city, and they shall be
@c    stoned.

@c    17:6. By the mouth of two or three witnesses shall he die that is to be
@c    slain.  Let no man be put to death, when only one beareth witness
@c    against him.

@c    17:7. The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to kill him,
@c    and afterwards the hands of the rest of the people:  that thou mayst
@c    take away the evil out of the midst of thee.

@c    17:8. If thou perceive that there be among you a hard and doubtful
@c    matter in judgment between blood and blood, cause and cause, leprosy
@c    and leprosy:  and thou see that the words of the judges within thy gates
@c    do vary:  arise, and go up to the place, which the Lord thy God shall
@c    choose.

@c    If thou perceive, etc. . .Here we see what authority God was pleased to
@c    give to the church guides of the Old Testament, in deciding, without
@c    appeal, all controversies relating to the law; promising that they
@c    should not err therein; and surely he has not done less for the church
@c    guides of the New Testament.

@c    17:9. And thou shalt come to the priests of the Levitical race, and to
@c    the judge, that shall be at that time:  and thou shalt ask of them, and
@c    they shall shew thee the truth of the judgment.

@c    17:10. And thou shalt do whatsoever they shall say, that preside in the
@c    place, which the Lord shall choose, and what they shall teach thee,

@c    17:11. According to his law; and thou shalt follow their sentence:
@c    neither shalt thou decline to the right hand nor to the left hand.

@c    17:12. But he that will be proud, and refuse to obey the commandment of
@c    the priest, who ministereth at that time to the Lord thy God, and the
@c    decree of the judge, that man shall die, and thou shalt take away the
@c    evil from Israel:

@c    17:13. And all the people hearing it shall fear, that no one afterwards
@c    swell with pride.

@c    17:14. When thou art come into the land, which the Lord thy God will
@c    give thee, and possessest it, and shalt say:  I will set a king over me,
@c    as all nations have that are round about:

@c    17:15. Thou shalt set him whom the Lord thy God shall choose out of the
@c    number of thy brethren.  Thou mayst not make a man of another nation
@c    king, that is not thy brother.

@c    17:16. And when he is made king, he shall not multiply horses to
@c    himself, nor lead back the people into Egypt, being lifted up with the
@c    number of his horsemen, especially since the Lord hath commanded you to
@c    return no more the same way.

@c    17:17. He shall not have many wives, that may allure his mind, nor
@c    immense sums of silver and gold.

@c    17:18. But after he is raised to the throne of his kingdom, he shall
@c    copy out to himself the Deuteronomy of this law in a volume, taking the
@c    copy of the priests of the Levitical tribe,

@c    17:19. And he shall have it with him, and shall read it all the days of
@c    his life, that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, and keep his
@c    words and ceremonies, that are commanded in the law;

@c    17:20. And that his heart be not lifted up with pride over his
@c    brethren, nor decline to the right or to the left, that he and his sons
@c    may reign a long time over Israel.



@c    Deuteronomy Chapter 18


@c    The Lord is the inheritance of the priests and Levites.  Heathenish
@c    abominations are to be avoided.  The great PROPHET CHRIST is promised.
@c    False prophets must be slain.

@c    18:1. The priests and Levites, and all that are of the same tribe,
@c    shall have no part nor inheritance with the rest of Israel, because
@c    they shall eat the sacrifices of the Lord, and his oblations,

@c    18:2. And they shall receive nothing else of the possession of their
@c    brethren:  for the Lord himself is their inheritance, as he hath said to
@c    them.

@c    18:3. This shall be the priest's due from the people, and from them
@c    that offer victims:  whether they sacrifice an ox, or a sheep, they
@c    shall give to the priest the shoulder and the breast:

@c    18:4. The firstfruits also of corn, of wine, and of oil, and a part of
@c    the wool from the shearing of their sheep.

@c    18:5. For the Lord thy God hath chosen him of all thy tribes, to stand
@c    and to minister to the name of the Lord, him and his sons for ever.

@c    18:6. If a Levite go out of any one of the cities throughout all
@c    Israel, in which he dwelleth, and have a longing mind to come to the
@c    place which the Lord shall choose,

@c    18:7. He shall minister in the name of the Lord his God, as all his
@c    brethren the Levites do, that shall stand at that time before the Lord.

@c    18:8. He shall receive the same portion of food that the rest do:
@c    besides that which is due to him in his own city, by succession from
@c    his fathers.

@c    18:9. When thou art come into the land which the Lord thy God shall
@c    give thee, beware lest thou have a mind to imitate the abominations of
@c    those nations.

@c    18:10. Neither let there be found among you any one that shall expiate
@c    his son or daughter, making them to pass through the fire:  or that
@c    consulteth soothsayers, or observeth dreams and omens, neither let
@c    there be any wizard,

@c    18:11. Nor charmer, nor any one that consulteth pythonic spirits, or
@c    fortune tellers, or that seeketh the truth from the dead.

@c    18:12. For the Lord abhorreth all these things, and for these
@c    abominations he will destroy them at thy coming.

@c    18:13. Thou shalt be perfect, and without spot before the Lord thy God.

@c    18:14. These nations, whose land thou shalt possess, hearken to
@c    soothsayers and diviners:  but thou art otherwise instructed by the Lord
@c    thy God.

@c    18:15. The Lord thy God will raise up to thee a PROPHET of thy nation
@c    and of thy brethren like unto me:  him thou shalt hear:

@c    18:16. As thou desiredst of the Lord thy God in Horeb, when the
@c    assembly was gathered together, and saidst:  Let me not hear any more
@c    the voice of the Lord my God, neither let me see any more this
@c    exceeding great fire, lest I die.

@c    18:17. And the Lord said to me:  They have spoken all things well.

@c    18:18. I will raise them up a prophet out of the midst of their
@c    brethren like to thee:  and I will put my words in his mouth, and he
@c    shall speak to them all that I shall command him.

@c    18:19. And he that will not hear his words, which he shall speak in my
@c    name, I will be the revenger.

@c    18:20. But the prophet, who being corrupted with pride, shall speak in
@c    my name things that I did not command him to say, or in the name of
@c    strange gods, shall be slain.

@c    18:21. And if in silent thought thou answer:  How shall I know the word
@c    that the Lord hath not spoken?

@c    18:22. Thou shalt have this sign:  Whatsoever that same prophet
@c    foretelleth in the name of the Lord, and it cometh not to pass:  that
@c    thing the Lord hath not spoken, but the prophet hath forged it by the
@c    pride of his mind:  and therefore thou shalt not fear him.



@c    Deuteronomy Chapter 19


@c    The cities of refuge.  Wilful murder, and false witnesses must be
@c    punished.

@c    19:1. When the Lord thy God hath destroyed the nations, whose land he
@c    will deliver to thee, and thou shalt possess it, and shalt dwell in the
@c    cities and houses thereof:

@c    19:2. Thou shalt separate to thee three cities in the midst of the
@c    land, which the Lord will give thee in possession,

@c    19:3. Paving diligently the way:  and thou shalt divide the whole
@c    province of thy land equally into three parts:  that he who is forced to
@c    flee for manslaughter, may have near at hand whither to escape.

@c    19:4. This shall be the law of the slayer that fleeth, whose life is to
@c    be saved:  He that killeth his neighbor ignorantly, and who is proved to
@c    have had no hatred against him yesterday and the day before:

@c    19:5. But to have gone with him to the wood to hew wood, and in cutting
@c    down the tree the axe slipped out of his hand, and the iron slipping
@c    from the handle struck his friend, and killed him:  he shall flee to one
@c    of the cities aforesaid, and live:

@c    19:6. Lest perhaps the next kinsman of him whose blood was shed, pushed
@c    on by his grief should pursue, and apprehend him, if the way be too
@c    long, and take away the life of him who is not guilty of death, because
@c    he is proved to have had no hatred before against him that was slain.

@c    19:7. Therefore I command thee, that thou separate three cities at
@c    equal distance one from another.

@c    19:8. And when the Lord thy God shall have enlarged thy borders, as he
@c    swore to the fathers, and shall give thee all the land that he promised
@c    them,

@c    19:9. (Yet so, if thou keep his commandments, and do the things which I
@c    command thee this day, that thou love the Lord thy God, and walk in his
@c    ways at all times) thou shalt add to thee other three cities, and shalt
@c    double the number of the three cities aforesaid:

@c    19:10. That innocent blood may not be shed in the midst of the land
@c    which the Lord thy God will give thee to possess, lest thou be guilty
@c    of blood.

@c    19:11. But if any man hating his neighbour, lie in wait for his life,
@c    and rise and strike him, and he die, and he flee to one of the cities
@c    aforesaid,

@c    19:12. The ancients of his city shall send, and take him out of the
@c    place of refuge, and shall deliver him into the hand of the kinsman of
@c    him whose blood was shed, and he shall die.

@c    19:13. Thou shalt not pity him, and thou shalt take away the guilt of
@c    innocent blood out of Israel, that it may be well with thee.

@c    19:14. Thou shalt not take nor remove thy neighbour's landmark, which
@c    thy predecessors have set in thy possession, which the Lord thy God
@c    will give thee in the land that thou shalt receive to possess.

@c    19:15. One witness shall not rise up against any man, whatsoever the
@c    sin or wickedness be:  but in the mouth of two or three witnesses every
@c    word shall stand.

@c    19:16. If a lying witness stand against a man, accusing him of
@c    transgression,

@c    19:17. Both of them, between whom the controversy is, shall stand
@c    before the Lord in the sight of the priests and the judges that shall
@c    be in those days.

@c    19:18. And when after most diligent inquisition, they shall find that
@c    the false witness hath told a lie against his brother:

@c    19:19. They shall render to him as he meant to do to his brother, and
@c    thou shalt take away the evil out of the midst of thee:

@c    19:20. That others hearing may fear, and may not dare to do such
@c    things.

@c    19:21. Thou shalt not pity him, but shalt require life for life, eye
@c    for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.



@c    Deuteronomy Chapter 20


@c    Laws relating to war.

@c    20:1. If thou go out to war against thy enemies, and see horsemen and
@c    chariots, and the numbers of the enemy's army greater than thine, thou
@c    shalt not fear them:  because the Lord thy God is with thee, who brought
@c    thee out of the land of Egypt.

@c    20:2. And when the battle is now at hand, the priest shall stand before
@c    the army, and shall speak to the people in this manner:

@c    20:3. Hear, O Israel, you join battle this day against your enemies,
@c    let not your heart be dismayed, be not afraid, do not give back, fear
@c    ye them not:

@c    20:4. Because the Lord your God is in the midst of you, and will fight
@c    for you against your enemies, to deliver you from danger.

@c    20:5. And the captains shall proclaim through every band in the hearing
@c    of the army:  What man is there, that hath built a new house, and hath
@c    not dedicated it?  let him go and return to his house, lest he die in
@c    the battle, and another man dedicate it.

@c    20:6. What man is there, that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not as
@c    yet made it to be common, whereof all men may eat?  let him go, and
@c    return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man execute
@c    his office.

@c    20:7. What man is there, that hath espoused a wife, and not taken her?
@c    let him go, and return to his house, lest he die in the war, and
@c    another man take her.

@c    20:8. After these things are declared they shall add the rest, and
@c    shall speak to the people:  What man is there that is fearful, and faint
@c    hearted?  let him go, and return to his house, lest he make the hearts
@c    of his brethren to fear, as he himself is possessed with fear.

@c    20:9. And when the captains of the army shall hold their peace, and
@c    have made an end of speaking, every man shall prepare their bands to
@c    fight.

@c    20:10. If at any time thou come to fight against a city, thou shalt
@c    first offer it peace.

@c    20:11. If they receive it, and open the gates to thee, all the people
@c    that are therein, shall be saved, and shall serve thee paying tribute.

@c    20:12. But if they will not make peace, and shall begin war against
@c    thee, thou shalt besiege it.

@c    20:13. And when the Lord thy God shall deliver it into thy hands, thou
@c    shalt slay all that are therein of the male sex, with the edge of the
@c    sword,

@c    20:14. Excepting women and children, cattle and other things, that are
@c    in the city.  And thou shalt divide all the prey to the army, and thou
@c    shalt eat the spoils of thy enemies, which the Lord thy God shall give
@c    thee.

@c    20:15. So shalt thou do to all cities that are at a great distance from
@c    thee, and are not of these cities which thou shalt receive in
@c    possession.

@c    20:16. But of those cities that shall be given thee, thou shalt suffer
@c    none at all to live:

@c    20:17. But shalt kill them with the edge of the sword, to wit, the
@c    Hethite, and the Amorrhite, and the Chanaanite, the Pherezite, and the
@c    Hevite, and the Jebusite, as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee:

@c    20:18. Lest they teach you to do all the abominations which they have
@c    done to their gods:  and you should sin against the Lord your God.

@c    20:19. When thou hast besieged a city a long time, and hath compassed
@c    it with bulwarks, to take it, thou shalt not cut down the trees that
@c    may be eaten of, neither shalt thou spoil the country round about with
@c    axes:  for it is a tree, and not a man, neither can it increase the
@c    number of them that fight against thee.

@c    20:20. But if there be any trees that are not fruitful, but wild, and
@c    fit for other uses, cut them down, and make engines, until thou take
@c    the city, which fighteth against thee.



@c    Deuteronomy Chapter 21


@c    The expiation of a secret murder.  The marrying a captive.  The eldest
@c    son must not be deprived of his birthright for hatred of his mother.  A
@c    stubborn son is to be stoned to death.  When one is hanged on a gibbet,
@c    he must be taken down the same day and buried.

@c    21:1. When there shall be found in the land, which the Lord thy God
@c    will give thee, the corpse of a man slain, and it is not known who is
@c    guilty of the murder,

@c    21:2. Thy ancients and judges shall go out, and shall measure from the
@c    place where the body lieth the distance of every city round about:

@c    21:3. And the ancients of that city which they shall perceive to be
@c    nearer than the rest, shall take a heifer of the herd, that hath not
@c    drawn in the yoke, nor ploughed the ground,

@c    21:4. And they shall bring her into a rough and stony valley, that
@c    never was ploughed, nor sown:  and there they shall strike off the head
@c    of the heifer:

@c    21:5. And the priests the sons of Levi shall come, whom the Lord thy
@c    God hath chosen to minister to him, and to bless in his name, and that
@c    by their word every matter should be decided, and whatsoever is clean
@c    or unclean should be judged.

@c    21:6. And the ancients of that city shall come to the person slain, and
@c    shall wash their hands over the heifer that was killed in the valley,

@c    21:7. And shall say:  Our hands did not shed this blood, nor did our
@c    eyes see it.

@c    21:8. Be merciful to thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, O
@c    Lord, and lay not innocent blood to their charge, in the midst of thy
@c    people Israel.  And the guilt of blood shall be taken from them:

@c    21:9. And thou shalt be free from the innocent's blood, that was shed,
@c    when thou shalt have done what the Lord hath commanded thee.

@c    21:10. If thou go out to fight against thy enemies, and the Lord thy
@c    God deliver them into thy hand, and thou lead them away captives,

@c    21:11. And seest in the number of the captives a beautiful woman, and
@c    lovest her, and wilt have her to wife,

@c    21:12. Thou shalt bring her into thy house:  and she shall shave her
@c    hair, and pare her nails,

@c    21:13. And shall put off the raiment, wherein she was taken:  and shall
@c    remain in thy house, and mourn for her father and mother one month:  and
@c    after that thou shalt go in unto her, and shalt sleep with her, and she
@c    shall be thy wife.

@c    21:14. But if afterwards she please thee not, thou shalt let her go
@c    free, but thou mayst not sell her for money nor oppress her by might
@c    because thou hast humbled her.

@c    21:15. If a man have two wives, one beloved, and the other hated, and
@c    they have had children by him, and the son of the hated be the
@c    firstborn,

@c    21:16. And he meaneth to divide his substance among his sons:  he may
@c    not make the son of the beloved the firstborn, and prefer him before
@c    the son of the hated.

@c    21:17. But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn,
@c    and shall give him a double portion of all he hath:  for this is the
@c    first of his children, and to him are due the first birthrights.

@c    21:18. If a man have a stubborn and unruly son, who will not hear the
@c    commandments of his father or mother, and being corrected, slighteth
@c    obedience:

@c    21:19. They shall take him and bring him to the ancients of the city,
@c    and to the gate of judgment,

@c    21:20. And shall say to them:  This our son is rebellious and stubborn,
@c    he slighteth hearing our admonitions, he giveth himself to revelling,
@c    and to debauchery and banquetings:

@c    21:21. The people of the city shall stone him:  and he shall die, that
@c    you may take away the evil out of the midst of you, and all Israel
@c    hearing it may be afraid.

@c    21:22. When a man hath committed a crime for which he is to be punished
@c    with death, and being condemned to die is hanged on a gibbet:

@c    21:23. His body shall not remain upon the tree, but shall be buried the
@c    same day:  for he is accursed of God that hangeth on a tree:  and thou
@c    shalt not defile thy land, which the Lord thy God shall give thee in
@c    possession.



@c    Deuteronomy Chapter 22


@c    Humanity towards neighbours.  Neither sex may use the apparel of the
@c    other.  Cruelty to be avoided even to birds.  Battlements about the roof
@c    of a house.  Things of divers kinds not to be mixed.  The punishment of
@c    him that slandereth his wife, as also of adultery and rape.

@c    22:1. Thou shalt not pass by if thou seest thy brother's ox, or his
@c    sheep go astray:  but thou shalt bring them back to thy brother.

@c    22:2. And if thy brother be not nigh, or thou know him not:  thou shalt
@c    bring them to thy house, and they shall be with thee until thy brother
@c    seek them, and receive them.

@c    22:3. Thou shalt do in like manner with his ass, and with his raiment,
@c    and with every thing that is thy brother's, which is lost:  if thou find
@c    it, neglect it not as pertaining to another.

@c    22:4. If thou see thy brother's ass or his ox to be fallen down in the
@c    way, thou shalt not slight it, but shalt lift it up with him.

@c    22:5. A woman shall not be clothed with man's apparel, neither shall a
@c    man use woman's apparel:  for he that doth these things is abominable
@c    before God.

@c    22:6. If thou find as thou walkest by the way, a bird's nest in a tree,
@c    or on the ground, and the dam sitting upon the young or upon the eggs:
@c    thou shalt not take her with her young:

@c    Thou shalt not take, etc.  This was to shew them to exercise a certain
@c    mercy even to irrational creatures; and by that means to train them up
@c    to a horror of cruelty; and to the exercise of humanity and mutual
@c    charity one to another.

@c    22:7. But shalt let her go, keeping the young which thou hast caught:
@c    that it may be well with thee, and thou mayst live a long time.

@c    22:8. When thou buildest a new house, thou shalt make a battlement to
@c    the roof round about:  lest blood be shed in thy house, and thou be
@c    guilty, if any one slip, and fall down headlong.

@c    Battlement. . .This precaution was necessary, because all their houses
@c    had flat tops, and it was usual to walk and to converse together upon
@c    them.

@c    22:9. Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds:  lest both the
@c    seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of the vineyard, be sanctified
@c    together.

@c    22:10. Thou shalt not plough with an ox and an ass together.

@c    22:11. Thou shalt not wear a garment that is woven of woollen and linen
@c    together.

@c    22:12. Thou shalt make strings in the hem at the four corners of thy
@c    cloak, wherewith thou shalt be covered.

@c    22:13. If a man marry a wife, and afterwards hate her,

@c    22:14. And seek occasions to put her away, laying to her charge a very
@c    ill name, and say:  I took this woman to wife, and going in to her, I
@c    found her not a virgin:

@c    22:15. Her father and mother shall take her, and shall bring with them
@c    the tokens of her virginity to the ancients of the city that are in the
@c    gate:

@c    22:16. And the father shall say:  I gave my daughter unto this man to
@c    wife:  and because he hateth her,

@c    22:17. He layeth to her charge a very ill name, so as to say:  I found
@c    not thy daughter a virgin:  and behold these are the tokens of my
@c    daughter's virginity.  And they shall spread the cloth before the
@c    ancients of the city:

@c    22:18. And the ancients of that city shall take that man, and beat him,

@c    22:19. Condemning him besides in a hundred sicles of silver, which he
@c    shall give to the damsel's father, because he hath defamed by a very
@c    ill name a virgin of Israel:  and he shall have her to wife, and may not
@c    put her away all the days of his life.

@c    22:20. But if what he charged her with be true, and virginity be not
@c    found in the damsel:

@c    22:21. They shall cast her out of the doors of her father's house, and
@c    the men of the city shall stone her to death, and she shall die:
@c    because she hath done a wicked thing in Israel, to play the whore in
@c    her father's house:  and thou shalt take away the evil out of the midst
@c    of thee.

@c    22:22. If a man lie with another man's wife, they shall both die, that
@c    is to say, the adulterer and the adulteress:  and thou shalt take away
@c    the evil out of Israel.

@c    22:23. If a man have espoused a damsel that is a virgin, and some one
@c    find her in the city, and lie with her,

@c    22:24. Thou shalt bring them both out to the gate of that city, and
@c    they shall be stoned:  the damsel, because she cried not out, being in
@c    the city:  the man, because he hath humbled his neighbour's wife.  And
@c    thou shalt take away the evil from the midst of thee.

@c    22:25. But if a man find a damsel that is betrothed, in the field, and
@c    taking hold of her, lie with her, he alone shall die:

@c    22:26. The damsel shall suffer nothing, neither is she guilty of death:
@c    for as a robber riseth against his brother, and taketh away his life,
@c    so also did the damsel suffer:

@c    22:27. She was alone in the field:  she cried, and there was no man to
@c    help her.

@c    22:28. If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, who is not espoused,
@c    and taking her, lie with her, and the matter come to judgment:

@c    22:29. He that lay with her shall give to the father of the maid fifty
@c    sicles of silver, and shall have her to wife, because he hath humbled
@c    her:  he may not put her away all the days of his life.

@c    22:30. No man shall take his father's wife, nor remove his covering.



@c    Deuteronomy Chapter 23


@c    Who may and who may not enter into the church:  uncleanness to be
@c    avoided:  other precepts concerning fugitives, fornication, usury, vows,
@c    and eating other men's grapes and corn.

@c    23:1. An eunuch, whose testicles are broken or cut away, or yard cut
@c    off, shall not enter into the church of the Lord.

@c    Eunuch. . .By these are meant, in the spiritual sense, such as are
@c    barren in good works.  Ibid.  Into the church. . .That is, into the
@c    assembly or congregation of Israel, so as to have the privilege of an
@c    Israelite, or to be capable of any place or office among the people of
@c    God.

@c    23:2. A mamzer, that is to say, one born of a prostitute, shall not
@c    enter into the church of the Lord, until the tenth generation.

@c    23:3. The Ammonite and the Moabite, even after the tenth generation
@c    shall not enter into the church of the Lord for ever:

@c    23:4. Because they would not meet you with bread and water in the way,
@c    when you came out of Egypt:  and because they hired against thee Balaam,
@c    the son of Beor, from Mesopotamia in Syria, to curse thee.

@c    23:5. And the Lord thy God would not hear Balaam, and he turned his
@c    cursing into thy blessing, because he loved thee.

@c    23:6. Thou shalt not make peace with them, neither shalt thou seek
@c    their prosperity all the days of thy life for ever.

@c    23:7. Thou shalt not abhor the Edomite, because he is thy brother:  nor
@c    the Egyptian, because thou wast a stranger in his land.

@c    23:8. They that are born of them, in the third generation shall enter
@c    into the church of the Lord.

@c    23:9. When thou goest out to war against thy enemies, thou shalt keep
@c    thyself from every evil thing.

@c    23:10. If there be among you any man, that is defiled in a dream by
@c    night, he shall go forth out of the camp,

@c    23:11. And shall not return, before he be washed with water in the
@c    evening:  and after sunset he shall return into the camp.

@c    23:12. Thou shalt have a place without the camp, to which thou mayst go
@c    for the necessities of nature,

@c    23:13. Carrying a paddle at thy girdle.  And when thou sittest down,
@c    thou shalt dig round about, and with the earth that is dug up thou
@c    shalt cover

@c    23:14. That which thou art eased of:  (for the Lord thy God walketh in
@c    the midst of thy camp, to deliver thee, and to give up thy enemies to
@c    thee:) and let thy camp be holy, and let no uncleanness appear therein,
@c    lest he go away from thee.

@c    No uncleanness. . .This caution against suffering any filth in the camp,
@c    was to teach them to fly the filth of sin, which driveth God away from
@c    the soul.

@c    23:15. Thou shalt not deliver to his master the servant that is fled to
@c    thee.

@c    23:16. He shall dwell with thee in the place that shall please him, and
@c    shall rest in one of thy cities:  give him no trouble.

@c    23:17. There shall be no whore among the daughters of Israel, nor
@c    whoremonger among the sons of Israel.

@c    23:18. Thou shalt not offer the hire of a strumpet, nor the price of a
@c    dog, in the house of the Lord thy God, whatsoever it be that thou hast
@c    vowed:  because both these are an abomination to the Lord thy God.

@c    23:19. Thou shalt not lend to thy brother money to usury, nor corn, nor
@c    any other thing:

@c    23:20. But to the stranger.  To thy brother thou shalt lend that which
@c    he wanteth, without usury:  that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all
@c    thy works in the land, which thou shalt go in to possess.

@c    To the stranger. . .This was a dispensation granted by God to his
@c    people, who being the Lord of all things, can give a right and title to
@c    one upon the goods of another.  Otherwise the scripture everywhere
@c    condemns usury, as contrary to the law of God, and a crying sin.  See
@c    Ex. 22.25; Lev. 25.36, 37; 2 Esd. 5.7; Ps. 14.5; Ezech. 18.8, 13, etc.

@c    23:21. When thou hast made a vow to the Lord thy God, thou shalt not
@c    delay to pay it:  because the Lord thy God will require it.  And if thou
@c    delay, it shall be imputed to thee for a sin.

@c    23:22. If thou wilt not promise, that shalt be without sin.

@c    23:23. But that which is once gone out of thy lips, thou shalt observe,
@c    and shalt do as thou hast promised to the Lord thy God, and hast spoken
@c    with thy own will and with thy own mouth.

@c    23:24. Going into thy neighbour's vineyard, thou mayst eat as many
@c    grapes as thou pleasest:  but must carry none out with thee:

@c    23:25. If thou go into thy friend's corn, thou mayst break the ears,
@c    and rub them in thy hand:  but not reap them with a sickle.



@c    Deuteronomy Chapter 24


@c    Divorce permitted to avoid greater evil:  the newly married must not go
@c    to war:  of men stealers, of leprosy, of pledges, of labourers' hire, of
@c    justice, and of charity to the poor.

@c    24:1. If a man take a wife, and have her, and she find not favour in
@c    his eyes, for some uncleanness:  he shall write a bill of divorce, and
@c    shall give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.

@c    24:2. And when she is departed, and marrieth another husband,

@c    24:3. And he also hateth her, and hath given her a bill of divorce, and
@c    hath sent her out of his house or is dead:

@c    24:4. The former husband cannot take her again to wife:  because she is
@c    defiled, and is become abominable before the Lord:  lest thou cause thy
@c    land to sin, which the Lord thy God shall give thee to possess.

@c    24:5. When a man hath lately taken a wife, he shall not go out to war,
@c    neither shall any public business be enjoined him, but he shall be free
@c    at home without fault, that for one year he may rejoice with his wife.

@c    24:6. Thou shalt not take the nether, nor the upper millstone to
@c    pledge:  for he hath pledged his life to thee.

@c    24:7. If any man be found soliciting his brother of the children of
@c    Israel, and selling him shall take a price, he shall be put to death,
@c    and thou shalt take away the evil from the midst of thee.

@c    24:8. Observe diligently that thou incur not the stroke of the leprosy,
@c    but thou shalt do whatsoever the priests of the Levitical race shall
@c    teach thee, according to what I have commanded them, and fulfil thou it
@c    carefully.

@c    24:9. Remember what the Lord your God did to Mary, in the way when you
@c    came out of Egypt.

@c    24:10. When thou shalt demand of thy neighbour any thing that he oweth
@c    thee, thou shalt not go into his house to take away a pledge:

@c    24:11. But thou shalt stand without, and he shall bring out to thee
@c    what he hath.

@c    24:12. But if he be poor, the pledge shall not lodge with thee that
@c    night,

@c    24:13. But thou shalt restore it to him presently before the going down
@c    of the sun:  that he may sleep in his own raiment and bless thee, and
@c    thou mayst have justice before the Lord thy God.

@c    24:14. Thou shalt not refuse the hire of the needy, and the poor,
@c    whether he be thy brother, or a stranger that dwelleth with thee in the
@c    land, and is within thy gates:

@c    24:15. But thou shalt pay him the price of his labour the same day,
@c    before the going down of the sun, because he is poor, and with it
@c    maintaineth his life:  lest he cry against thee to the Lord, and it be
@c    reputed to thee for a sin.

@c    24:16. The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the
@c    children for the fathers, but every one shall die for his own sin,

@c    24:17. Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger nor of the
@c    fatherless, neither shalt thou take away the widow's raiment for a
@c    pledge.

@c    24:18. Remember that thou wast a slave in Egypt, and the Lord thy God
@c    delivered thee from thence.  Therefore I command thee to do this thing.

@c    24:19. When thou hast reaped the corn in thy field, and hast forgot and
@c    left a sheaf, thou shalt not return to take it away:  but thou shalt
@c    suffer the stranger, and the fatherless and the widow to take it away:
@c    that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all the works of thy hands.

@c    24:20. If thou have gathered the fruit of thy olive trees, thou shalt
@c    not return to gather whatsoever remaineth on the trees:  but shalt leave
@c    it for the stranger, for the fatherless, and the widow.

@c    24:21. If thou make the vintage of thy vineyard, thou shalt not gather
@c    the clusters that remain, but they shall be for the stranger, the
@c    fatherless, and the widow.

@c    24:22. Remember that thou also wast a bondman in Egypt, and therefore I
@c    command thee to do this thing.



@c    Deuteronomy Chapter 25


@c    Stripes must not exceed forty.  The ox is not to be muzzled.  Of raising
@c    seed to the brother.  Of the immodest woman.  Of unjust weight.  Of
@c    destroying the Amalecites.

@c    25:1. If there be a controversy between men, and they call upon the
@c    judges:  they shall give the prize of justice to him whom they perceive
@c    to be just:  and him whom they find to be wicked, they shall condemn of
@c    wickedness.

@c    25:2. And if they see that the offender be worthy of stripes:  they
@c    shall lay him down, and shall cause him to be beaten before them.
@c    According to the measure of the sin shall the measure also of the
@c    stripes be:

@c    25:3. Yet so, that they exceed not the number of forty:  lest thy
@c    brother depart shamefully torn before thy eyes.

@c    25:4. Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out thy corn on the
@c    floor.

@c    Not muzzle, etc. . .St. Paul understands this of the spiritual labourer
@c    in the church of God, who is not to be denied his maintenance.  1 Cor.
@c    9.8, 9, 10.

@c    25:5. When brethren dwell together, and one of them dieth without
@c    children, the wife of the deceased shall not marry to another:  but his
@c    brother shall take her, and raise up seed for his brother:

@c    25:6. And the first son he shall have of her he shall call by his name,
@c    that his name be not abolished out of Israel.

@c    25:7. But if he will not take his brother's wife, who by law belongeth
@c    to him, the woman shall go to the gate of the city, and call upon the
@c    ancients, and say:  My husband's brother refuseth to raise up his
@c    brother's name in Israel:  and will not take me to wife.

@c    25:8. And they shall cause him to be sent for forthwith, and shall ask
@c    him.  If he answer:  I will not take her to wife:

@c    25:9. The woman shall come to him before the ancients, and shall take
@c    off his shoe from his foot, and spit in his face, and say:  So shall it
@c    be done to the man that will not build up his brother's house:

@c    25:10. And his name shall be called in Israel, the house of the unshod.

@c    25:11. If two men have words together, and one begin to fight against
@c    the other, and the other's wife willing to deliver her husband out of
@c    the hand of the stronger, shall put forth her hand, and take him by the
@c    secrets,

@c    25:12. Thou shalt cut off her hand, neither shalt thou be moved with
@c    any pity in her regard.

@c    25:13. Thou shalt not have divers weights in thy bag, a greater and a
@c    less:

@c    25:14. Neither shall there be in thy house a greater bushel and a less.

@c    25:15. Thou shalt have a just and a true weight, and thy bushel shall
@c    be equal and true:  that thou mayest live a long time upon the land
@c    which the Lord thy God shall give thee.

@c    25:16. For the Lord thy God abhorreth him that doth these things, and
@c    he hateth all injustice.

@c    25:17. Remember what Amalec did to thee in the way when thou camest out
@c    of Egypt:

@c    Amalec. . .This order for destroying the Amalecites, in the mystical
@c    sense, sheweth how hateful they are to God, and what punishments they
@c    are to look for from his justice, who attack and discourage his
@c    servants when they are but just come out, as it were, of the Egypt of
@c    this wicked world and being yet weak and fainthearted, are but
@c    beginning their journey to the land of promise.

@c    25:18. How he met thee:  and slew the hindmost of the army, who sat
@c    down, being weary, when thou wast spent with hunger and labour, and he
@c    feared not God.

@c    25:19. Therefore when the Lord thy God shall give thee rest, and shall
@c    have subdued all the nations round about in the land which he hath
@c    promised thee:  thou shalt blot out his name from under heaven.  See thou
@c    forget it not.



@c    Deuteronomy Chapter 26


@c    The form of words with which the firstfruits and tithes are to be
@c    offered.  God's covenant.

@c    26:1. And when thou art come into the land which the Lord thy God will
@c    give thee to possess, and hast conquered it, and dwellest in it:

@c    basket, and shalt go to the place which the Lord thy God shall choose,
@c    that his name may be invocated there:

@c    26:3. And thou shalt go to the priest that shall be in those days, and
@c    say to him:  I profess this day before the Lord thy God, that I am come
@c    into the land, for which he swore to our fathers, that he would give it
@c    us.

@c    26:4. And the priest taking the basket at thy hand, shall set it before
@c    the altar of the Lord thy God:

@c    26:5. And thou shalt speak thus in the sight of the Lord thy God:  The
@c    Syrian pursued my father, who went down into Egypt, and sojourned there
@c    in a very small number, and grew into a nation great and strong and of
@c    an infinite multitude.

@c    The Syrian. . .Laban.  See Gen. 27.

@c    26:6. And the Egyptians afflicted us, and persecuted us, laying on us
@c    most grievous burdens:

@c    26:7. And we cried to the Lord God of our fathers:  who heard us, and
@c    looked down upon our affliction, and labour, and distress:

@c    26:8. And brought us out of Egypt with a strong hand, and a stretched
@c    out arm, with great terror, with signs and wonders:

@c    26:9. And brought us into this place, and gave us this land flowing
@c    with milk and honey.

@c    26:10. And therefore now I offer the firstfruits of the land which the
@c    Lord hath given me.  And thou shalt leave them in the sight of the Lord
@c    thy God, adoring the Lord thy God.

@c    26:11. And thou shalt feast in all the good things which the Lord thy
@c    God hath given thee, and thy house, thou and the Levite, and the
@c    stranger that is with thee.

@c    26:12. When thou hast made an end of tithing all thy fruits, in the
@c    third year of tithes thou shalt give it to the Levite, and to the
@c    stranger, and to the fatherless, and to the widow, that they may eat
@c    within thy gates, and be filled:

@c    26:13. And thou shalt speak thus in the sight of the Lord thy God:  I
@c    have taken that which was sanctified out of my house, and I have given
@c    it to the Levite, and to the stranger, and to the fatherless, and to
@c    the widow, as thou hast commanded me:  I have not transgressed thy
@c    commandments nor forgotten thy precepts.

@c    26:14. I have not eaten of them in my mourning, nor separated them for
@c    any uncleanness, nor spent any thing of them in funerals.  I have obeyed
@c    the voice of the Lord my God, and have done all things as thou hast
@c    commanded me.

@c    26:15. Look from thy sanctuary, and thy high habitation of heaven, and
@c    bless thy people Israel, and the land which thou hast given us, as thou
@c    didst swear to our fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey.

@c    26:16. This day the Lord thy God hath commanded thee to do these
@c    commandments and judgments:  and to keep and fulfil them with all thy
@c    heart, and with all thy soul.

@c    26:17. Thou hast chosen the Lord this day to be thy God, and to walk in
@c    his ways and keep his ceremonies, and precepts, and judgments, and obey
@c    his command.

@c    26:18. And the Lord hath chosen thee this day, to be his peculiar
@c    people, as he hath spoken to thee, and to keep all his commandments:

@c    26:19. And to make thee higher than all nations which he hath created,
@c    to his own praise, and name, and glory:  that thou mayst be a holy
@c    people of the Lord thy God, as he hath spoken.



@c    Deuteronomy Chapter 27


@c    The commandments must be written on stones:  and an altar erected, and
@c    sacrifices offered.  The observers of the commandments are to be
@c    blessed, and the transgressors cursed.

@c    27:1. And Moses with the ancients of Israel commanded the people,
@c    saying:  Keep every commandment that I command you this day.

@c    27:2. And when you are passed over the Jordan into the land which the
@c    Lord thy God will give thee, thou shalt set up great stones, and shalt
@c    plaster them over with plaster,

@c    27:3. That thou mayst write on them all the words of this law, when
@c    thou art passed over the Jordan:  that thou mayst enter into the land
@c    which the Lord thy God will give thee, a land flowing with milk and
@c    honey, as he swore to thy fathers.

@c    27:4. Therefore when you are passed over the Jordan, set up the stones
@c    which I command you this day, in mount Hebal, and thou shalt plaster
@c    them with plaster:

@c    27:5. And thou shalt build there an altar to the Lord thy God, of
@c    stones which iron hath not touched,

@c    27:6. And of stones not fashioned nor polished:  and thou shalt offer
@c    upon it holocausts to the Lord thy God:

@c    27:7. And shalt immolate peace victims, and eat there, and feast before
@c    the Lord thy God.

@c    27:8. And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law
@c    plainly and clearly.

@c    27:9. And Moses and the priests of the race of Levi said to all Israel:
@c    Attend, and hear, O Israel:  This day thou art made the people of the
@c    Lord thy God:

@c    27:10. Thou shalt hear his voice, and do the commandments and justices
@c    which I command thee.

@c    27:11. And Moses commanded the people in that day, saying:

@c    27:12. These shall stand upon mount Garizim to bless the people, when

@c    Deuteronomy Chapter 28


@c    Many blessings are promised to observers of God's commandments:  and
@c    curses threatened to transgressors.

@c    28:1. Now if thou wilt hear the voice of all his commandments, which I
@c    command thee this day, the Lord thy God will make thee higher than all
@c    the nations that are on the earth.

@c    28:2. And all these blessings shall come upon thee and overtake thee:
@c    yet so if thou hear his precepts.

@c    All these blessings, etc. . .In the Old Testament, God promised temporal
@c    blessings to the keepers of his law, heaven not being opened as yet;
@c    and that gross and sensual people being more moved with present and
@c    sensible things.  But in the New Testament the goods that are promised
@c    us are spiritual and eternal; and temporal evils are turned into
@c    blessings.

@c    28:3. Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed in the field.

@c    28:4. Blessed shall be the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy
@c    ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, the droves of thy herds, and the
@c    folds of thy sheep.

@c    28:5. Blessed shall be thy barns and blessed thy stores.

@c    28:6. Blessed shalt thou be coming in and going out.

@c    28:7. The Lord shall cause thy enemies, that rise up against thee, to
@c    fall down before thy face:  one way shall they come out against thee,
@c    and seven ways shall they flee before thee.

@c    28:8. The Lord will send forth a blessing upon thy storehouses, and
@c    upon all the works of thy hands:  and will bless thee in the land that
@c    thou shalt receive.

@c    28:9. The Lord will raise thee up to be a holy people to himself, as he
@c    swore to thee:  if thou keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, and
@c    walk in his ways.

@c    28:10. And all the people of the earth shall see that the name of the
@c    Lord is invocated upon thee, and they shall fear thee.

@c    28:11. The Lord will make thee abound with all goods, with the fruit of
@c    thy womb, and the fruit of thy cattle, with the fruit of thy land,
@c    which the Lord swore to thy fathers that he would give thee.

@c    28:12. The Lord will open his excellent treasure, the heaven, that it
@c    may give rain in due season:  and he will bless all the works of thy
@c    hands.  And thou shalt lend to many nations, and shalt not borrow of any
@c    one.

@c    28:13. And the Lord shall make thee the head and not the tail:  and thou
@c    shalt be always above, and not beneath:  yet so if thou wilt hear the
@c    commandments of the Lord thy God which I command thee this day, and
@c    keep and do them,

@c    28:14. And turn not away from them neither to the right hand, nor to
@c    the left, nor follow strange gods, nor worship them.

@c    28:15. But if thou wilt not hear the voice of the Lord thy God, to keep
@c    and to do all his commandments and ceremonies, which I command thee
@c    this day, all these curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee.

@c    All these curses, etc. . .Thus God dealt with the transgressors of his
@c    law in the Old Testament:  but now he often suffers sinners to prosper
@c    in this world, rewarding them for some little good they have done, and
@c    reserving their punishment for the other world.

@c    28:16. Cursed shalt thou be in the city, cursed in the field.

@c    28:17. Cursed shall be thy barn, and cursed thy stores.

@c    28:18. Cursed shall be the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy
@c    ground, the herds of thy oxen, and the flocks of thy sheep.

@c    28:19. Cursed shalt thou be coming in, and cursed going out.

@c    28:20. The Lord shall send upon thee famine and hunger, and a rebuke
@c    upon all the works which thou shalt do:  until he consume and destroy
@c    thee quickly, for thy most wicked inventions, by which thou hast
@c    forsaken me.

@c    28:21. May the Lord set the pestilence upon thee, until he consume thee
@c    out of the land, which thou shalt go in to possess.

@c    28:22. May the Lord afflict thee with miserable want, with the fever
@c    and with cold, with burning and with heat, and with corrupted air and
@c    with blasting, and pursue thee till thou perish.

@c    28:23. Be the heaven, that is over thee, of brass:  and the ground thou
@c    treadest on, of iron.

@c    28:24. The Lord give thee dust for rain upon thy land, and let ashes
@c    come down from heaven upon thee, till thou be consumed.

@c    28:25. The Lord make thee to fall down before thy enemies, one way
@c    mayst thou go out against them, and flee seven ways, and be scattered
@c    throughout all the kingdoms of the earth.

@c    28:26. And be thy carcass meat for all the fowls of the air, and the
@c    beasts of the earth, and be there none to drive them away.

@c    28:27. The Lord strike thee with the ulcer of Egypt, and the part of
@c    thy body, by which the dung is cast out, with the scab and with the
@c    itch:  so that thou canst not be healed.

@c    28:28. The Lord strike thee with madness and blindness and fury of
@c    mind.

@c    28:29. And mayst thou grope at midday as the blind is wont to grope in
@c    the dark, and not make straight thy ways.  And mayst thou at all times
@c    suffer wrong, and be oppressed with violence, and mayst thou have no
@c    one to deliver thee.

@c    28:30. Mayst thou take a wife, and another sleep with her.  Mayst thou
@c    build a house, and not dwell therein.  Mayest thou plant a vineyard and
@c    not gather the vintage thereof.

@c    28:31. May thy ox be slain before thee, and thou not eat thereof.  May
@c    thy ass be taken away in thy sight, and not restored to thee.  May thy
@c    sheep be given to thy enemies, and may there be none to help thee.

@c    28:32. May thy sons and thy daughters be given to another people, thy
@c    eyes looking on, and languishing at the sight of them all the day, and
@c    may there be no strength in thy hand.

@c    28:33. May a people which thou knowest not, eat the fruits of thy land,
@c    and all thy labours:  and mayst thou always suffer oppression, and be
@c    crushed at all times.

@c    28:34. And be astonished at the terror of those things which thy eyes
@c    shall see:

@c    28:35. May the Lord strike thee with a very sore ulcer in the knees and
@c    in the legs, and be thou incurable from the sole of the foot to the top
@c    of the head.

@c    28:36. The Lord shall bring thee, and thy king, whom thou shalt have
@c    appointed over thee, into a nation which thou and thy fathers know not:
@c    and there thou shalt serve strange gods, wood and stone.

@c    28:37. And thou shalt be lost, as a proverb and a byword to all people,
@c    among whom the Lord shall bring thee in.

@c    28:38. Thou shalt cast much seed into the ground, and gather little:
@c    because the locusts shall consume all.

@c    28:39. Thou shalt plant a vineyard, and dig it, and shalt not drink the
@c    wine, nor gather any thing thereof:  because it shall be wasted with
@c    worms.

@c    28:40. Thou shalt have olive trees in all thy borders, and shalt not be
@c    anointed with the oil:  for the olives shall fall off and perish.

@c    28:41. Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, and shalt not enjoy them:
@c    because they shall be led into captivity.

@c    28:42. The blast shall consume all the trees and the fruits of thy
@c    ground.

@c    28:43. The stranger that liveth with thee in the land, shall rise up
@c    over thee, and shall be higher:  and thou shalt go down, and be lower.

@c    28:44. He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him.  He shall
@c    be as the head, and thou shalt be the tail.

@c    28:45. And all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue and
@c    overtake thee, till thou perish:  because thou heardst not the voice of
@c    the Lord thy God, and didst not keep his commandments and ceremonies
@c    which he commanded thee.

@c    28:46. And they shall be as signs and wonders on thee, and on thy seed
@c    for ever.

@c    28:47. Because thou didst not serve the Lord thy God with joy and
@c    gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things:

@c    28:48. Thou shalt serve thy enemy, whom the Lord will send upon thee,
@c    in hunger, and thirst, and nakedness, and in want of all things:  and he
@c    shall put an iron yoke upon thy neck, till he consume thee.

@c    28:49. The Lord will bring upon thee a nation from afar, and from the
@c    uttermost ends of the earth, like an eagle that flyeth swiftly, whose
@c    tongue thou canst not understand,

@c    28:50. A most insolent nation, that will shew no regard to the
@c    ancients, nor have pity on the infant,

@c    28:51. And will devour the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruits of thy
@c    land:  until thou be destroyed, and will leave thee no wheat, nor wine,
@c    nor oil, nor herds of oxen, nor flocks of sheep:  until he destroy thee.

@c    28:52. And consume thee in all thy cities, and thy strong and high wall
@c    be brought down, wherein thou trustedst in all thy land.  Thou shalt be
@c    besieged within thy gates in all thy land which the Lord thy God will
@c    give thee:

@c    28:53. And thou shalt eat the fruit of thy womb, and the flesh of thy
@c    sons and of thy daughters, which the Lord thy God shall give thee, in
@c    the distress and extremity wherewith thy enemy shall oppress thee.

@c    28:54. The man that is nice among you, and very delicate, shall envy
@c    his own brother, and his wife, that lieth in his bosom,

@c    28:55. So that he will not give them of the flesh of his children,
@c    which he shall eat:  because he hath nothing else in the siege and the
@c    want, wherewith thy enemies shall distress thee within all thy gates.

@c    28:56. The tender and delicate woman, that could not go upon the
@c    ground, nor set down her foot for over much niceness and tenderness,
@c    will envy her husband who lieth in her bosom, the flesh of her son, and
@c    of her daughter,

@c    28:57. And the filth of the afterbirths, that come forth from between
@c    her thighs, and the children that are born the same hour.  For they
@c    shall eat them secretly for the want of all things, in the siege and
@c    distress, wherewith thy enemy shall oppress thee within thy gates.

@c    28:58. If thou wilt not keep, and fulfil all the words of this law,
@c    that are written in this volume, and fear his glorious and terrible
@c    name:  that is, The Lord thy God:

@c    28:59. The Lord shall increase thy plagues, and the plagues of thy
@c    seed, plagues great and lasting, infirmities grievous and perpetual.

@c    28:60. And he shall bring back on thee all the afflictions of Egypt,
@c    which thou wast afraid of, and they shall stick fast to thee.

@c    28:61. Moreover the Lord will bring upon thee all the diseases, and
@c    plagues, that are not written in the volume of this law till he consume
@c    thee:

@c    28:62. And you shall remain few in number, who before were as the stars
@c    of heaven for multitude, because thou heardst not the voice of the Lord
@c    thy God.

@c    28:63. And as the Lord rejoiced upon you before doing good to you, and
@c    multiplying you:  so he shall rejoice destroying and bringing you to
@c    nought, so that you shall be taken away from the land which thou shalt
@c    go in to possess.

@c    28:64. The Lord shall scatter thee among all people, from the farthest
@c    parts of the earth to the ends thereof:  and there thou shalt serve
@c    strange gods, which both thou art ignorant of and thy fathers, wood and
@c    stone.

@c    28:65. Neither shalt thou be quiet, even in those nations, nor shall
@c    there be any rest for the sole of thy foot.  For the Lord will give thee
@c    a fearful heart, and languishing eyes, and a soul consumed with
@c    pensiveness:

@c    28:66. And thy life shall be as it were hanging before thee.  Thou shalt
@c    fear night and day, neither shalt thou trust thy life.

@c    28:67. In the morning thou shalt say:  Who will grant me evening?  and at
@c    evening:  Who will grant me morning?  for the fearfulness of thy heart,
@c    wherewith thou shalt be terrified, and for those things which thou
@c    shalt see with thy eyes.

@c    28:68. The Lord shall bring thee again with ships into Egypt, by the
@c    way whereof he said to thee that thou shouldst see it no more.  There
@c    shalt thou be set to sale to thy enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and
@c    no man shall buy you.



@c    Deuteronomy Chapter 29


@c    The covenant is solemnly confirmed between God and his people.  Threats
@c    against those that shall break it.

@c    29:1. These are the words of the covenant which the Lord commanded
@c    Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab:  beside
@c    that covenant which he made with them in Horeb.

@c    29:2. And Moses called all Israel, and said to them:  You have seen all
@c    the things that the Lord did before you in the land of Egypt to Pharao,
@c    and to all his servants, and to his whole land.

@c    29:3. The great temptations, which thy eyes have seen, those mighty
@c    signs and wonders,

@c    29:4. And the Lord hath not given you a heart to understand, and eyes
@c    to see, and ears that may hear, unto this present day.

@c    Hath not given you, etc. . .Through your own fault and because you
@c    resisted his grace.

@c    29:5. He hath brought you forty years through the desert:  your garments
@c    are not worn out, neither are the shoes of your feet consumed with age.

@c    29:6. You have not eaten bread, nor have you drunk wine or strong
@c    drink:  that you might know that I am the Lord your God.

@c    29:7. And you came to this place:  and Sehon king of Hesebon, and Og
@c    king of Basan, came out against us to fight.  And we slew them.

@c    29:8. And took their land, and delivered it for a possession to Ruben
@c    and Gad, and the half tribe of Manasses.

@c    29:9. Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and fulfil them:  that
@c    you may understand all that you do.

@c    29:10. You all stand this day before the Lord your God, your princes,
@c    and tribes, and ancients, and doctors, all the people of Israel,

@c    29:11. Your children and your wives, and the stranger that abideth with
@c    thee in the camp, besides the hewers of wood, and them that bring
@c    water:

@c    29:12. That thou mayst pass in the covenant of the Lord thy God, and in
@c    the oath which this day the Lord thy God maketh with thee.

@c    29:13. That he may raise thee up a people to himself, and he may be thy
@c    God as he hath spoken to thee, and as he swore to thy fathers Abraham,
@c    Isaac, and Jacob.

@c    29:14. Neither with you only do I make this covenant, and confirm these
@c    oaths,

@c    29:15. But with all that are present and that are absent.

@c    29:16. For you know how we dwelt in the land of Egypt, and how we have
@c    passed through the midst of nations, and passing through them,

@c    29:17. You have seen their abominations and filth, that is to say,
@c    their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which they worshipped.

@c    29:18. Lest perhaps there should be among you a man or a woman, a
@c    family or a tribe, whose heart is turned away this day from the Lord
@c    our God, to go and serve the gods of those nations:  and there should be
@c    among you a root bringing forth gall and bitterness.

@c    29:19. And when he shall hear the words of this oath, he should bless
@c    himself in his heart saying:  I shall have peace, and will walk on in
@c    the naughtiness of my heart:  and the drunken may consume the thirsty,

@c    The drunken, etc., absumat ebria sitientem. . .It is a proverbial
@c    expression, which may either be understood, as spoken by the sinner,
@c    blessing, that is, flattering himself in his sins with the imagination
@c    of peace, and so great an abundance as may satisfy, and as it were,
@c    consume all thirst and want:  or it may be referred to the root of
@c    bitterness, spoken of before, which being drunken with sin may attract,
@c    and by that means consume, such as thirst after the like evils.

@c    29:20. And the Lord should not forgive him:  but his wrath and jealousy
@c    against that man should be exceedingly enkindled at that time, and all
@c    the curses that are written in this volume should light upon him:  and
@c    the Lord should blot out his name from under heaven,

@c    29:21. And utterly destroy him out of all the tribes of Israel,
@c    according to the curses that are contained in the book of this law and
@c    covenant:

@c    29:22. And the following generation shall say, and the children that
@c    shall be born hereafter, and the strangers that shall come from afar,
@c    seeing the plagues of that land and the evils wherewith the Lord hath
@c    afflicted it,

@c    29:23. Burning it with brimstone, and the heat of salt, so that it
@c    cannot be sown any more, nor any green thing grow therein, after the
@c    example of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrha, Adama and Seboim,
@c    which the Lord destroyed in his wrath and indignation:

@c    29:24. And all the nations shall say:  Why hath the Lord done thus to
@c    this land?  what meaneth this exceeding great heat of his wrath?

@c    29:25. And they shall answer:  Because they forsook the covenant of the
@c    Lord, which he made with their fathers, when he brought them out of the
@c    land of Egypt:

@c    29:26. And they have served strange gods, and adored them, whom they
@c    knew not, and for whom they had not been assigned:

@c    29:27. Therefore the wrath of the Lord was kindled against this land,
@c    to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this volume:

@c    29:28. And he hath cast them out of their land, in anger and in wrath,
@c    and in very great indignation, and hath thrown them into a strange
@c    land, as it is seen this day.

@c    29:29. Secret things to the Lord our God:  things that are manifest, to
@c    us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this
@c    law.

@c    Secret things, etc. . .As much as to say, secret things belong to, and
@c    are known to, God alone; our business must be to observe what he has
@c    revealed and manifested to us, and to direct our lives accordingly.



@c    Deuteronomy Chapter 30


@c    Great mercies are promised to the penitent:  God's commandment is
@c    feasible.  Life and death are set before them.

@c    30:1. Now when all these things shall be come upon thee, the blessing
@c    or the curse, which I have set forth before thee, and thou shalt be
@c    touched with repentance of thy heart among all the nations, into which
@c    the Lord thy God shall have scattered thee,

@c    30:2. And shalt return to him, and obey his commandments, as I command
@c    thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thy heart, and with all
@c    thy soul:

@c    30:3. The Lord thy God will bring back again thy captivity, and will
@c    have mercy on thee, and gather thee again out of all the nations, into
@c    which he scattered thee before.

@c    30:4. If thou be driven as far as the poles of heaven, the Lord thy God
@c    will fetch thee back from hence,

@c    30:5. And will take thee to himself, and bring thee into the land which
@c    thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it:  and blessing thee, he
@c    will make thee more numerous than were thy fathers.

@c    30:6. The Lord thy God will circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy
@c    seed:  that thou mayst love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with
@c    all thy soul, that thou mayst live.

@c    30:7. And he will turn all these curses upon thy enemies, and upon them
@c    that hate and persecute thee.

@c    30:8. But thou shalt return, and hear the voice of the Lord thy God,
@c    and shalt do all the commandments which I command thee this day:

@c    30:9. And the Lord thy God will make thee abound in all the works of
@c    thy hands, in the fruit of thy womb, and in the fruit of thy cattle, in
@c    the fruitfulness of thy land, and in the plenty of all things.  For the
@c    Lord will return to rejoice over thee in all good things, as he
@c    rejoiced in thy fathers:

@c    30:10. Yet so if thou hear the voice of the Lord thy God, and keep his
@c    precepts and ceremonies, which are written in this law:  and return to
@c    the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul.

@c    30:11. This commandment, that I command thee this day is not above
@c    thee, nor far off from thee:

@c    30:12. Nor is it in heaven, that thou shouldst say:  Which of us can go
@c    up to heaven to bring it unto us, and we may hear and fulfil it in
@c    work?

@c    30:13. Nor is it beyond the sea:  that thou mayst excuse thyself, and
@c    say:  Which of us can cross the sea, and bring it unto us:  that we may
@c    hear, and do that which is commanded?

@c    30:14. But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth and in thy
@c    heart, that thou mayst do it.

@c    30:15. Consider that I have set before thee this day life and good, and
@c    on the other hand death and evil:

@c    30:16. That thou mayst love the Lord thy God, and walk in his ways, and
@c    keep his commandments and ceremonies and judgments, and bless thee in
@c    the land, which thou shalt go in to possess.

@c    30:17. But if thy heart be turned away, so that thou wilt not hear, and
@c    being deceived with error thou adore strange gods, and serve them:

@c    30:18. I foretell thee this day that thou shalt perish, and shalt
@c    remain but a short time in the land, to which thou shalt pass over the
@c    Jordan, and shalt go in to possess it.

@c    30:19. I call heaven and earth to witness this day, that I have set
@c    before you life and death, blessing and cursing.  Choose therefore life,
@c    that both thou and thy seed may live:

@c    30:20. And that thou mayst love the Lord thy God, and obey his voice,
@c    and adhere to him (for he is thy life, and the length of thy days,)
@c    that thou mayst dwell in the land, for which the Lord swore to thy
@c    fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that he would give it them.



@c    Deuteronomy Chapter 31


@c    Moses encourageth the people, and Josue, who is appointed to succeed
@c    him.  He delivereth the law to the priests.  God foretelleth that the
@c    people will often forsake him, and that he will punish them.  He
@c    commandeth Moses to write a canticle, as a constant remembrancer of the
@c    law.

@c    31:1. And Moses went, and spoke all these words to all Israel,

@c    31:2. And he said to them:  I am this day a hundred and twenty years
@c    old, I can no longer go out and come in, especially as the Lord also
@c    hath said to me:  Thou shalt not pass over this Jordan.

@c    31:3. The Lord thy God then will pass over before thee:  he will destroy
@c    all these nations in thy sight, and thou shalt possess them:  and this
@c    Josue shall go over before thee, as the Lord hath spoken.

@c    31:4. And the Lord shall do to them as he did to Sehon and Og the kings
@c    of the Amorrhites, and to their land, and shall destroy them.

@c    31:5. Therefore when the Lord shall have delivered these also to you,
@c    you shall do in like manner to them as I have commanded you.

@c    31:6. Do manfully and be of good heart:  fear not, nor be ye dismayed at
@c    their sight:  for the Lord thy God he himself is thy leader, and will
@c    not leave thee nor forsake thee.

@c    31:7. And Moses called Josue, and said to him before all Israel:  Take
@c    courage, and be valiant:  for thou shalt bring this people into the land
@c    which the Lord swore he would give to their fathers, and thou shalt
@c    divide it by lot.

@c    31:8. And the Lord who is your leader, he himself will be with thee:  he
@c    will not leave thee, nor forsake thee:  fear not, neither be dismayed.

@c    31:9. And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it to the priests the
@c    sons of Levi, who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and to
@c    all the ancients of Israel.

@c    31:10. And he commanded them, saying:  After seven years, in the year of
@c    remission, in the feast of tabernacles,

@c    31:11. When all Israel come together, to appear in the sight of the
@c    Lord thy God in the place which the Lord shall choose, thou shalt read
@c    the words of this law before all Israel, in their hearing.

@c    31:12. And the people being all assembled together, both men and women,
@c    children and strangers, that are within thy gates:  that hearing they
@c    may learn, and fear the Lord your God, and keep, and fulfil all the
@c    words of this law:

@c    31:13. That their children also, who now are ignorant, may hear, and
@c    fear the Lord their God, all the days that they live in the land
@c    whither you are going over the Jordan to possess it.

@c    31:14. And the Lord said to Moses:  Behold the days of thy death are
@c    nigh:  call Josue, and stand ye in the tabernacle of the testimony, that
@c    I may give him a charge.  So Moses and Josue went and stood in the
@c    tabernacle of the testimony:

@c    31:15. And the Lord appeared there in the pillar of a cloud, which
@c    stood in the entry of the tabernacle.

@c    31:16. And the Lord said to Moses:  Behold thou shalt sleep with thy
@c    fathers, and this people rising up will go a fornicating after strange
@c    gods in the land, to which it goeth in to dwell:  there will they
@c    forsake me, and will make void the covenant, which I have made with
@c    them,

@c    31:17. And my wrath shall be kindled against them in that day:  and I
@c    will forsake them, and will hide my face from them, and they shall be
@c    devoured:  all evils and afflictions shall find them, so that they shall
@c    say in that day:  In truth it is because God is not with me, that these
@c    evils have found me.

@c    31:18. But I will hide, and cover my face in that day, for all the
@c    evils which they have done, because they have followed strange gods.

@c    31:19. Now therefore write you this canticle, and teach the children of
@c    Israel:  that they may know it by heart, and sing it by mouth, and this
@c    song may be unto me for a testimony among the children of Israel.

@c    31:20. For I will bring them into the land, for which I swore to their
@c    fathers, that floweth with milk and honey.  And when they have eaten,
@c    and are full and fat, they will turn away after strange gods, and will
@c    serve them:  and will despise me, and make void my covenant.

@c    31:21. And after many evils and afflictions shall have come upon them,
@c    this canticle shall answer them for a testimony, which no oblivion
@c    shall take away out of the mouth of their seed.  For I know their
@c    thoughts, and what they are about to do this day, before that I bring
@c    them into the land which I have promised them.

@c    31:22. Moses therefore wrote the canticle, and taught it to the
@c    children of Israel.

@c    31:23. And the Lord commanded Josue the son of Nun, and said:  Take
@c    courage, and be valiant:  for thou shalt bring the children of Israel
@c    into the land which I have promised, and I will be with thee.

@c    31:24. Therefore after Moses had wrote the words of this law in a
@c    volume, and finished it:

@c    31:25. He commanded the Levites, who carried the ark of the covenant of
@c    the Lord, saying:

@c    31:26. Take this book, and put it in the side of the ark of the
@c    covenant of the Lord your God:  that it may be there for a testimony
@c    against thee.

@c    31:27. For I know thy obstinacy, and thy most stiff neck.  While I am
@c    yet living, and going in with you, you have always been rebellious
@c    against the Lord:  how much more when I shall be dead?

@c    31:28. Gather unto me all the ancients of your tribes, and your
@c    doctors, and I will speak these words in their hearing, and will call
@c    heaven and earth to witness against them.

@c    31:29. For I know that, after my death, you will do wickedly, and will
@c    quickly turn aside form the way that I have commanded you:  and evils
@c    shall come upon you in the latter times, when you shall do evil in the
@c    sight of the Lord, to provoke him by the works of your hands.

@c    31:30. Moses therefore spoke, in the hearing of the whole assembly of
@c    Israel, the words of this canticle, and finished it even to the end.



@c    Deuteronomy Chapter 32


@c    A canticle for the remembrance of the law.  Moses is commanded to go up
@c    into a mountain, from whence he shall see the promised land but not
@c    enter into it.

@c    32:1. Hear, O ye heavens, the things I speak, let the earth give ear to
@c    the words of my mouth.

@c    32:2. Let my doctrine gather as the rain, let my speech distil as the
@c    dew, as a shower upon the herb, and as drops upon the grass.

@c    32:3. Because I will invoke the name of the Lord:  give ye magnificence
@c    to our God.

@c    32:4. The works of God are perfect, and all his ways are judgments:  God
@c    is faithful and without any iniquity, he is just and right.

@c    32:5. They have sinned against him, and are none of his children in
@c    their filth:  they are a wicked and perverse generation.

@c    32:6. Is this the return thou makest to the Lord, O foolish and
@c    senseless people?  Is not he thy father, that hath possessed thee, and
@c    made thee, and created thee?

@c    32:7. Remember the days of old, think upon every generation:  ask thy
@c    father, and he will declare to thee:  thy elders and they will tell
@c    thee.

@c    32:8. When the Most High divided the nations:  when he separated the
@c    sons of Adam, he appointed the bounds of people according to the number
@c    of the children of Israel.

@c    32:9. But the Lord's portion is his people:  Jacob the lot of his
@c    inheritance.

@c    32:10. He found him in a desert land, in a place of horror, and of vast
@c    wilderness:  he led him about, and taught him:  and he kept him as the
@c    apple of his eye.

@c    32:11. As the eagle enticing her young to fly, and hovering over them,
@c    he spread his wings, and hath taken him and carried him on his
@c    shoulders.

@c    32:12. The Lord alone was his leader:  and there was no strange god with
@c    him.

@c    32:13. He set him upon high land:  that he might eat the fruits of the
@c    fields, that he might suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the
@c    hardest stone,

@c    32:14. Butter of the herd, and milk of the sheep with the fat of lambs,
@c    and of the rams of the breed of Basan:  and goats with the marrow of
@c    wheat, and might drink the purest blood of the grape.

@c    32:15. The beloved grew fat, and kicked:  he grew fat, and thick and
@c    gross, he forsook God who made him, and departed from God his saviour.

@c    32:16. They provoked him by strange gods, and stirred him up to anger,
@c    with their abominations.

@c    32:17. They sacrificed to devils and not to God:  to gods whom they knew
@c    not:  that were newly come up, whom their fathers worshipped not.

@c    32:18. Thou hast forsaken the God that begot thee, and hast forgotten
@c    the Lord that created thee.

@c    32:19. The Lord saw, and was moved to wrath:  because his own sons and
@c    daughters provoked him.

@c    32:20. And he said:  I will hide my face from them, and will consider
@c    what their last end shall be:  for it is a perverse generation, and
@c    unfaithful children.

@c    32:21. They have provoked me with that which was no god, and have
@c    angered me with their vanities:  and I will provoke them with that which
@c    is no people, and will vex them with a foolish nation.

@c    32:22. A fire is kindled in my wrath, and shall burn even to the lowest
@c    hell:  and shall devour the earth with her increase, and shall burn the
@c    foundations of the mountains.

@c    32:23. I will heap evils upon them, and will spend my arrows among
@c    them.

@c    32:24. They shall be consumed with famine, and birds shall devour them
@c    with a most bitter bite:  I will send the teeth of beasts upon them,
@c    with the fury of creatures that trail upon the ground, and of serpents.

@c    32:25. Without, the sword shall lay them waste, and terror within, both
@c    the young man and the virgin, the sucking child with the man in years.

@c    32:26. I said:  Where are they?  I will make the memory of them to cease
@c    from among men.

@c    32:27. But for the wrath of the enemies I have deferred it:  lest
@c    perhaps their enemies might be proud, and should say:  Our mighty hand,
@c    and not the Lord, hath done all these things.

@c    32:28. They are a nation without counsel, and without wisdom.

@c    32:29. O that they would be wise and would understand, and would
@c    provide for their last end.

@c    32:30. How should one pursue after a thousand, and two chase ten
@c    thousand?  Was it not, because their God had sold them, and the Lord had
@c    shut them up?

@c    32:31. For our God is not as their gods:  our enemies themselves are
@c    judges.

@c    32:32. Their vines are of the vineyard of Sodom, and of the suburbs of
@c    Gomorrha:  their grapes are grapes of gall, and their clusters most
@c    bitter.

@c    32:33. Their wine is the gall of dragons, and the venom of asps, which
@c    is incurable.

@c    32:34. Are not these things stored up with me, and sealed up in my
@c    treasures?

@c    32:35. Revenge is mine, and I will repay them in due time, that their
@c    foot may slide:  the day of destruction is at hand, and the time makes
@c    haste to come.

@c    32:36. The Lord will judge his people, and will have mercy on his
@c    servants:  he shall see that their hand is weakened, and that they who
@c    were shut up have also failed, and they that remained are consumed.

@c    32:37. And he shall say:  Where are their gods, in whom they trusted?

@c    32:38. Of whose victims they ate the fat, and drank the wine of their
@c    drink offerings:  let them arise and help you, and protect you in your
@c    distress.

@c    32:39. See ye that I alone am, and there is no other God besides me:  I
@c    will kill and I will make to live:  I will strike, and I will heal, and
@c    there is none that can deliver out of my hand.

@c    32:40. I will lift up my hand to heaven, and I will say:  I live for
@c    ever.

@c    32:41. If I shall whet my sword as the lightning, and my hand take hold
@c    on judgment:  I will render vengeance to my enemies, and repay them that
@c    hate me.

@c    32:42. I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall
@c    devour flesh, of the blood of the slain and of the captivity, of the
@c    bare head of the enemies.

@c    32:43. Praise his people, ye nations, for he will revenge the blood of
@c    his servants:  and will render vengeance to their enemies, and he will
@c    be merciful to the land of his people.

@c    32:44. So Moses came and spoke all the words of this canticle in the
@c    ears of the people, and Josue the son of Nun.

@c    32:45. And he ended all these words, speaking to all Israel.

@c    32:46. And he said to them:  Set your hearts on all the words, which I
@c    testify to you this day:  which you shall command your children to
@c    observe and to do, and to fulfil all that is written in this law:

@c    32:47. For they are not commanded you in vain, but that every one
@c    should live in them, and that doing them you may continue a long time
@c    in the land whither you are going over the Jordan to possess it.

@c    32:48. And the Lord spoke to Moses the same day, saying:

@c    32:49. Go up into this mountain Abarim, (that is to say, of passages,)
@c    unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab over against Jericho:  and
@c    see the land of Chanaan, which I will deliver to the children of Israel
@c    to possess, and die thou in the mountain.

@c    32:50. When thou art gone up into it thou shalt be gathered to thy
@c    people, as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered to his
@c    people:

@c    32:51. Because you trespassed against me in the midst of the children
@c    of Israel, at the waters of contradiction, in Cades of the desert of
@c    Sin:  and you did not sanctify me among the children of Israel.

@c    32:52. Thou shalt see the land before thee, which I will give to the
@c    children of Israel, but thou shalt not enter into it.



@c    Deuteronomy Chapter 33


@c    Moses before his death blesseth the tribes of Israel.

@c    33:1. This is the blessing, wherewith the man of God, Moses, blessed
@c    the children of Israel, before his death.

@c    33:2. And he said:  The Lord came from Sinai, and from Seir he rose up
@c    to us:  he hath appeared from mount Pharan, and with him thousands of
@c    saints.  In his right hand a fiery law.

@c    33:3. He hath loved the people, all the saints are in his hand:  and
@c    they that approach to his feet, shall receive of his doctrine.

@c    33:4. Moses commanded us a law, the inheritance of the multitude of
@c    Jacob.

@c    33:5. He shall be king with the most right, the princes of the people,
@c    being assembled with the tribes of Israel.

@c    33:6. Let Ruben live, and not die, and be he small in number.

@c    33:7. This is the blessing of Juda.  Hear, O Lord, the voice of Juda,
@c    and bring him in unto his people:  his hands shall fight for him, and he
@c    shall be his helper against his enemies.

@c    33:8. To Levi also he said:  Thy perfection, and thy doctrine be to thy
@c    holy man, whom thou hast proved in the temptation, and judged at the
@c    waters of contradiction:

@c    Holy man. . .Aaron and his successors in the priesthood.

@c    33:9. Who hath said to his father, and to his mother:  I do not know
@c    you; and to his brethren:  I know you not:  and their own children they
@c    have not known.  These have kept thy word, and observed thy covenant,

@c    Who hath said, etc. . .It is the duty of the priestly tribe to prefer
@c    God's honour and service before all considerations of flesh and blood:
@c    in such manner as to behave as strangers to their nearest akin, when
@c    these would withdraw them from the business of their calling.

@c    33:10. Thy judgments, O Jacob, and thy law, O Israel:  they shall put
@c    incense in thy wrath and holocaust upon thy altar.

@c    33:11. Bless, O Lord, his strength, and receive the works of his hands.
@c    Strike the backs of his enemies, and let not them that hate him rise.

@c    33:12. And to Benjamin he said:  The best beloved of the Lord shall
@c    dwell confidently in him:  as in a bride chamber shall he abide all the
@c    day long, and between his shoulders shall be rest.

@c    Shall dwell, etc. . .This seems to allude to the temple being built in
@c    the confines of the tribe of Benjamin.

@c    33:13. To Joseph also he said:  Of the blessing of the Lord be his land,
@c    of the fruits of heaven, and of the dew, and of the deep that lieth
@c    beneath.

@c    33:14. Of the fruits brought forth by the sun and by the moon.

@c    33:15. Of the tops of the ancient mountains, of the fruits of the
@c    everlasting hills:

@c    33:16. And of the fruits of the earth, and of the fulness thereof.  The
@c    blessing of him that appeared in the bush, come upon the head of
@c    Joseph, and upon the crown of the Nazarite among his brethren.

@c    The Nazarite. . .See the note on Gen. 49.26.

@c    33:17. His beauty as of the firstling of a bullock, his horns as the
@c    horns of a rhinoceros:  with them shall he push the nations even to the
@c    ends of the earth.  These are the multitudes of Ephraim and these the
@c    thousands of Manasses.

@c    33:18. And to Zabulon he said:  Rejoice, O Zabulon, in thy going out;
@c    and Issachar in thy tabernacles.

@c    33:19. They shall call the people to the mountain:  there shall they
@c    sacrifice the victims of justice.  Who shall suck as milk the abundance
@c    of the sea, and the hidden treasures of the sands.

@c    33:20. And to Gad he said:  Blessed be Gad in his breadth:  he hath
@c    rested as a lion, and hath seized upon the arm and the top of the head.

@c    33:21. And he saw his pre-eminence, that in his portion the teacher was
@c    laid up:  who was with the princes of the people, and did the justices
@c    of the Lord, and his judgment with Israel.

@c    He saw, etc. . .The pre-eminence of the tribe of Gad, to which this
@c    alludeth, was their having the lawgiver Moses buried in their borders;
@c    though the particular place was not known.

@c    33:22. To Dan also he said:  Dan is a young lion, he shall flow
@c    plentifully from Basan.

@c    33:23. And To Nephtali he said:  Nephtali shall enjoy abundance, and
@c    shall be full of the blessings of the Lord:  he shall possess the sea
@c    and the south.

@c    The sea. . .The lake of Genesareth.

@c    33:24. To Aser also he said:  Let Aser be blessed with children, let him
@c    be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil.

@c    33:25. His shoe shall be iron and brass.  As the days of thy youth, so
@c    also shall thy old age be.

@c    33:26. There is no other god like the God of the rightest:  he that is
@c    mounted upon the heaven is thy helper.  By his magnificence the clouds
@c    run hither and thither.

@c    33:27. His dwelling is above, and underneath are the everlasting arms:
@c    he shall cast out the enemy from before thee, and shall say:  Be thou
@c    brought to nought.

@c    Underneath are the everlasting arms. . .Though the dwelling of God be
@c    above in heaven, his arms are always stretched out to help us here
@c    below.

@c    33:28. Israel shall dwell in safety, and alone.  The eye of Jacob in a
@c    land of corn and wine, and the heavens shall be misty with dew.

@c    33:29. Blessed art thou, Israel:  who is like to thee, O people, that
@c    art saved by the Lord?  the shield of thy help, and the sword of thy
@c    glory:  thy enemies shall deny thee, and thou shalt tread upon their
@c    necks.



@c    Deuteronomy Chapter 34


@c    Moses seeth the promised land, but is not suffered to go into it.  He
@c    dieth at the age of 120 years.  God burieth his body secretly, and all
@c    Israel mourn for him thirty days.  Josue, replenished (by imposition of
@c    Moses's hands) with the spirit of God, succeedeth.  But Moses, for his
@c    special familiarity with God, and for most wonderful miracles, is
@c    commended above all other prophets.

@c    34:1. Then Moses went up from the plains of Moab upon mount Nebo, to
@c    the top of Phasga over against Jericho:  and the Lord shewed him all the
@c    land of Galaad as far as Dan.

@c    34:2. And all Nephtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasses, and all
@c    the land of Juda unto the furthermost sea,

@c    34:3. And the south part, and the breadth of the plain of Jericho the
@c    city of palm trees as far as Segor.

@c    34:4. And the Lord said to him:  This is the land, for which I swore to
@c    Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying:  I will give it to thy seed.  Thou
@c    hast seen it with thy eyes, and shalt not pass over to it.

@c    34:5. And Moses the servant of the Lord died there, in the land of
@c    Moab, by the commandment of the Lord:

@c    Died there. . .This last chapter of Deuteronomy, in which the death of
@c    Moses is related, was written by Josue, or by some of the prophets.

@c    34:6. And he buried him in the valley of the land of Moab over against
@c    Phogor:  and no man hath known of his sepulchre until this present day.

@c    He buried him, viz. . .by the ministry of angels, and would have the
@c    place of his burial to be unknown, lest the Israelites, who were so
@c    prone to idolatry, might worship him with divine honours.

@c    34:7. Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died:  his eye
@c    was not dim, neither were his teeth moved.

@c    34:8. And the children of Israel mourned for him in the plains of Moab
@c    thirty days:  and the days of their mourning in which they mourned Moses
@c    were ended.

@c    34:9. And Josue the son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom,
@c    because Moses had laid his hands upon him.  And the children of Israel
@c    obeyed him, and did as the Lord commanded Moses.

@c    34:10. And there arose no more a prophet in Israel like unto Moses,
@c    whom the Lord knew face to face,

@c    34:11. In all the signs and wonders, which he sent by him, to do in the
@c    land of Egypt to Pharao, and to all his servants, and to his whole
@c    land,

@c    34:12. And all the mighty hand, and great miracles, which Moses did
@c    before all Israel.
