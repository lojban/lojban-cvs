@c    HISTORY
@c    
@c    
@c    This e-text comes from multiple editions of Challoner's revised Douay-
@c    Rheims Version of the Holy Bible.  In 1568 English exiles, many from
@c    Oxford, established the English College of Douay (Douai/Doway), Flanders,
@c    under William (later Cardinal) Allen.  In October, 1578, Gregory Martin
@c    began the work of preparing an English translation of the Bible for
@c    Catholic readers, the first such translation into Modern English.
@c    Assisting were William Allen, Richard Bristow, Thomas Worthington, and
@c    William Reynolds who revised, criticized, and corrected Dr. Martin's
@c    work.  The college published the New Testament at Rheims (Reims/Rhemes),
@c    France, in 1582 through John Fogny with a preface and explanatory notes,
@c    authored chiefly by Bristol, Allen, and Worthington.  Later the Old
@c    Testament was published at Douay in two parts (1609 and 1610) by Laurence
@c    Kellam through the efforts of Dr. Worthington, then superior of the
@c    seminary.  The translation had been prepared before the appearance of the
@c    New Testament, but the publication was delayed due to financial
@c    difficulties.  The religious and scholarly adherence to the Latin Vulgate
@c    text led to the less elegant and idiomatic words and phrases often found
@c    in the translation.  In some instances where no English word conveyed the
@c    full meaning of the Latin, a Latin word was Anglicized and its meaning
@c    defined in a glossary.  Although ridiculed by critics, many of these
@c    words later found common usage in the English language.  Spellings of
@c    proper names and the numbering of the Psalms are adopted from the Latin
@c    Vulgate.
@c    
@c    In 1749 Dr. Richard Challoner began a major revision of the Douay and
@c    Rheims texts, the spellings and phrasing of which had become increasingly
@c    archaic in the almost two centuries since the translations were first
@c    produced.  He modernized the diction and introduced a more fluid style,
@c    while faithfully maintaining the accuracy of Dr. Martin's texts.  This
@c    revision became the 'de facto' standard text for English speaking
@c    Catholics until the twentieth century.  It is still highly regarded by
@c    many for its style, although it is now rarely used for liturgical
@c    purposes.  The notes included in this electronic edition are generally
@c    attributed to Bishop Challoner.
@c    
@c    The 1610 printing of the second tome of the Old Testament includes an
@c    appendix containing the non-canonical books 'Prayer of Manasses,' 'Third
@c    Booke of Esdras,' and 'Fourth Booke of Esdras.'  While not part of
@c    Challoner's revision, the 1610 texts are placed in the appendices of
@c    this e-text.  Also included are the original texts of two short books,
@c    'The Prophecie of Abdias' and 'The Catholike Epistle of Iude the
@c    Apostle,' to give the reader a sense of the language of the first
@c    editions in comparison to the Challoner revision.  Further background on
@c    the Douay-Rheims version may be found in a selection from the preface to
@c    the 1582 edition and the original glossary included in the appendices.
