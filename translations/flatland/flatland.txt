Some conventions I'm using:

{romi} (which is assigned to {fo'i}) represents the people of Flatland, when
Square is speaking on behalf of them. {fo'i} is used so {mi} can continue to
refer to Square. Sometimes {pami} is used for clarification.

{fa'a} always represents orientation.

Because of Edwin Abbott's long-winded style, I found it useful to include
commas in the Lojban text, so that the reader knows when the sentence is
jumping back up to a higher level. I have tried to include a comma wherever
a significant number of terminators have been omitted; usually three, but not
in trivial cases like "le nu broda cu..."

I don't know how DocBook works, so I'm faking it with the "comment lines".

@c I call our world Flatland, not because we call it so,
@c but to make its nature clearer to you, my happy readers,
@c who are privileged to live in Space.

@c Imagine a vast sheet of paper on which straight Lines,
@c Triangles, Squares, Pentagons, Hexagons, and other figures,
@c instead of remaining fixed in their places, move freely about,
@c on or in the surface, but without the power of rising above
@c or sinking below it, very much like shadows--only hard
@c with luminous edges--and you will then have a pretty correct
@c notion of my country and countrymen.  Alas, a few years ago,
@c I should have said "my universe:"  but now my mind has been
@c opened to higher views of things.

@c In such a country, you will perceive at once that it is
@c impossible that there should be anything of what you call
@c a "solid" kind; but I dare say you will suppose that
@c we could at least distinguish by sight the Triangles, Squares,
@c and other figures, moving about as I have described them.
@c On the contrary, we could see nothing of the kind,
@c not at least so as to distinguish one figure from another.
@c Nothing was visible, nor could be visible, to us,
@c except Straight Lines; and the necessity of this
@c I will speedily demonstrate.

@c Place a penny on the middle of one of your tables in Space; and
@c leaning over it, look down upon it.  It will appear a circle.

@c But now, drawing back to the edge of the table, gradually lower
@c your eye (thus bringing yourself more and more into the condition
@c of the inhabitants of Flatland), and you will find the penny
@c becoming more and more oval to your view, and at last when you
@c have placed your eye exactly on the edge of the table
@c (so that you are, as it were, actually a Flatlander)
@c the penny will then have ceased to appear oval at all,
@c and will have become, so far as you can see, a straight line.

@c The same thing would happen if you were to treat
@c in the same way a Triangle, or a Square, or any other figure
@c cut out from pasteboard.  As soon as you look at it with your eye
@c on the edge of the table, you will find that it ceases to appear
@c to you as a figure, and that it becomes in appearance a straight line.
@c Take for example an equilateral Triangle--who represents with us
@c a Tradesman of the respectable class.  Figure 1 represents
@c the Tradesman as you would see him while you were bending over
@c him from above; figures 2 and 3 represent the Tradesman,
@c as you would see him if your eye were close to the level,
@c or all but on the level of the table; and if your eye were
@c quite on the level of the table (and that is how we see him
@c in Flatland) you would see nothing but a straight line.

@c When I was in Spaceland I heard that your sailors
@c have very similar experiences while they traverse
@c your seas and discern some distant island or coast
@c lying on the horizon.  The far-off land may have bays,
@c forelands, angles in and out to any number and extent;
@c yet at a distance you see none of these (unless indeed
@c your sun shines bright upon them revealing the projections
@c and retirements by means of light and shade), nothing but
@c a grey unbroken line upon the water.

@c Well, that is just what we see when one of our triangular
@c or other acquaintances comes towards us in Flatland.
@c As there is neither sun with us, nor any light of such
@c a kind as to make shadows, we have none of the helps
@c to the sight that you have in Spaceland.
@c If our friend comes closer to us we see
@c his line becomes larger; if he leaves us
@c it becomes smaller; but still he looks like
@c a straight line; be he a Triangle, Square,
@c Pentagon, Hexagon, Circle, what you will--
@c a straight Line he looks and nothing else.

@c You may perhaps ask how under these disadvantagous circumstances
@c we are able to distinguish our friends from one another:
@c but the answer to this very natural question will be more fitly
@c and easily given when I come to describe the inhabitants of Flatland.
@c For the present let me defer this subject, and say a word or two
@c about the climate and houses in our country.

@c SECTION 2  Of the Climate and Houses in Flatland

ni'oni'o
pi'eremo'o srana le tcima ja zdani pe la pitmu'e

@c As with you, so also with us, there are four points
@c of the compass North, South, East, and West.

ni'o do .e fo'i po'u romi te cmene le vo ralju farna la berti .e la snanu .e la
stuna .e la stici

@c There being no sun nor other heavenly bodies, it is impossible
@c for us to determine the North in the usual way; but we have
@c a method of our own.  By a Law of Nature with us,
@c there is a constant attraction to the South;
@c and, although in temperate climates this is very slight--
@c so that even a Woman in reasonable health can journey
@c several furlongs northward without much difficulty--
@c yet the hampering effort of the southward attraction
@c is quite sufficient to serve as a compass in most parts
@c of our earth.  Moreover, the rain (which falls
@c at stated intervals) coming always from the North,
@c is an additional assistance; and in the towns
@c we have the guidance of the houses,
@c which of course have their side-walls
@c running for the most part North and South,
@c so that the roofs may keep off the rain from the North.
@c In the country, where there are no houses,
@c the trunks of the trees serve as some sort of guide.
@c Altogether, we have not so much difficulty as might
@c be expected in determining our bearings.

@c Yet in our more temperate regions, in which
@c the southward attraction is hardly felt,
@c walking sometimes in a perfectly desolate plain
@c where there have been no houses nor trees to guide me,
@c I have been occasionally compelled to remain stationary
@c for hours together, waiting till the rain came
@c before continuing my journey.  On the weak and aged,
@c and especially on delicate Females, the force of attraction
@c tells much more heavily than on the robust of the Male Sex,
@c so that it is a point of breeding, if you meet a Lady on the street,
@c always to give her the North side of the way--by no means
@c an easy thing to do always at short notice when you are
@c in rude health and in a climate where it is difficult
@c to tell your North from your South.

@c Windows there are none in our houses:  for the light
@c comes to us alike in our homes and out of them,
@c by day and by night, equally at all times and in all places,
@c whence we know not.  It was in old days, with our learned men,
@c an interesting and oft-investigate question,
@c "What is the origin of light?" and the solution of it
@c has been repeatedly attempted, with no other result
@c than to crowd our lunatic asylums with the would-be solvers.
@c Hence, after fruitless attempts to suppress such investigations
@c indirectly by making them liable to a heavy tax, the Legislature,
@c in comparatively recent times, absolutely prohibited them.
@c I--alas, I alone in Flatland--know now only too well
@c the true solution of this mysterious problem;
@c but my knowledge cannot be made intelligible
@c to a single one of my countrymen; and I am mocked at
@c --I, the sole possessor of the truths of Space
@c and of the theory of the introduction of Light
@c from the world of three Dimensions--as if I were
@c the maddest of the mad!  But a truce to these painful
@c digressions:  let me return to our homes.

@c The most common form for the construction of a house
@c is five-sided or pentagonal, as in the annexed figure.
@c The two Northern sides RO, OF, constitute the roof,
@c and for the most part have no doors; on the East is
@c a small door for the Women; on the West a much larger
@c one for the Men; the South side or floor is usually doorless.

@c Square and triangular houses are not allowed,
@c and for this reason.  The angles of a Square
@c (and still more those of an equilateral Triangle,)
@c being much more pointed than those of a Pentagon,
@c and the lines of inanimate objects (such as houses)
@c being dimmer than the lines of Men and Women,
@c it follows that there is no little danger
@c lest the points of a square of triangular house
@c residence might do serious injury to an inconsiderate
@c or perhaps absentminded traveller suddenly running against them:
@c and therefore, as early as the eleventh century of our era,
@c triangular houses were universally forbidden by Law,
@c the only exceptions being fortifications, powder-magazines,
@c barracks, and other state buildings, which is not desirable
@c that the general public should approach without circumspection.

@c At this period, square houses were still everywhere permitted,
@c though discouraged by a special tax.  But, about three centuries
@c afterwards, the Law decided that in all towns containing a population
@c above ten thousand, the angle of a Pentagon was the smallest
@c house-angle that could be allowed consistently with the public safety.
@c The good sense of the community has seconded the efforts of the
@c Legislature; and now, even in the country, the pentagonal construction
@c has superseded every other.  It is only now and then in some very
@c remote and backward agricultural district that an antiquarian may
@c still discover a square house.

@c SECTION 3  Concerning the Inhabitants of Flatland

ni'oni'o
pi'ecimo'o srana le xabju be la pitmu'e

@c The greatest length or breadth of a full grown inhabitant
@c of Flatland may be estimated at about eleven of your inches.
@c Twelve inches may be regarded as a maximum.
@c 
@c Our Women are Straight Lines.
@c 
@c Our Soldiers and Lowest Class of Workmen are Triangles
@c with two equal sides, each about eleven inches long,
@c and a base or third side so short (often not exceeding
@c half an inch) that they form at their vertices
@c a very sharp and formidable angle.  Indeed when their bases
@c are of the most degraded type (not more than the eighth part
@c of an inch in size), they can hardly be distinguished from
@c Straight lines or Women; so extremely pointed are their vertices.
@c With us, as with you, these Triangles are distinguished
@c from others by being called Isosceles; and by this name
@c I shall refer to them in the following pages.
@c 
@c Our Middle Class consists of Equilateral or Equal-Sided Triangles.
@c 
@c Our Professional Men and Gentlemen are Squares (to which class
@c I myself belong) and Five-Sided Figures or Pentagons.
@c 
@c Next above these come the Nobility, of whom there
@c are several degrees, beginning at Six-Sided Figures,
@c or Hexagons, and from thence rising in the number of their
@c sides till they receive the honourable title of Polygonal,
@c or many-Sided. Finally when the number of the sides becomes so numerous,
@c and the sides themselves so small, that the figure cannot be
@c distinguished from a circle, he is included in the Circular
@c or Priestly order; and this is the highest class of all.
@c 
@c It is a Law of Nature with us that a male child shall have
@c one more side than his father, so that each generation
@c shall rise (as a rule) one step in the scale of development
@c and nobility. Thus the son of a Square is a Pentagon;
@c the son of a Pentagon, a Hexagon; and so on. 
@c 
@c But this rule applies not always to the Tradesman,
@c and still less often to the Soldiers, and to the Workmen;
@c who indeed can hardly be said to deserve the name of human Figures,
@c since they have not all their sides equal.  With them therefore
@c the Law of Nature does not hold; and the son of an Isosceles
@c (i.e. a Triangle with two sides equal) remains Isosceles still.
@c Nevertheless, all hope is not such out, even from the Isosceles,
@c that his posterity may ultimately rise above his degraded condition.
@c For, after a long series of military successes, or diligent
@c and skillful labours, it is generally found that the more
@c intelligent among the Artisan and Soldier classes manifest
@c a slight increase of their third side or base, and a shrinkage
@c of the two other sides.  Intermarriages (arranged by the Priests)
@c between the sons and daughters of these more intellectual
@c members of the lower classes generally result in an offspring
@c approximating still more to the type of the Equal-Sided Triangle.
@c 
@c Rarely--in proportion to the vast numbers of Isosceles births--
@c is a genuine and certifiable Equal-Sided Triangle produced from
@c Isosceles parents (footnote 1).  Such a birth requires, as its
@c antecedents, not only a series of carefully arranged intermarriages,
@c but also a long-continued exercise of frugality and self-control
@c on the part of the would-be ancestors of the coming Equilateral,
@c and a patient, systematic, and continuous development of the Isosceles
@c intellect through many generations.
@c 
@c The birth of a True Equilateral Triangle from Isosceles parents
@c is the subject of rejoicing in our country for many furlongs round. 
@c After a strict examination conducted by the Sanitary and Social Board,
@c the infant, if certified as Regular, is with solemn ceremonial
@c admitted into the class of Equilaterals.  He is then immediately
@c taken from his proud yet sorrowing parents and adopted by some
@c childless Equilateral, who is bound by oath never to permit
@c the child henceforth to enter his former home or so much
@c as to look upon his relations again, for fear lest the freshly
@c developed organism may, by force of unconscious imitation,
@c fall back again into his hereditary level.
@c 
@c The occasional emergence of an Equilateral from the ranks
@c of his serf-born ancestors is welcomed, not only by the poor
@c serfs themselves, as a gleam of light and hope shed upon
@c the monotonous squalor of their existence, but also by
@c the Aristocracy at large; for all the higher classes
@c are well aware that these rare phenomena, while they
@c do little or nothing to vulgarize their own privileges,
@c serve as almost useful barrier against revolution from below.
@c 
@c Had the acute-angled rabble been all, without exception,
@c absolutely destitute of hope and of ambition, they might
@c have found leaders in some of their many seditious outbreaks,
@c so able as to render their superior numbers and strength
@c too much even for the wisdom of the Circles.
@c But a wise ordinance of Nature has decreed that
@c in proportion as the working-classes increase in intelligence,
@c knowledge, and all virtue, in that same proportion their
@c acute angle (which makes them physically terrible)
@c shall increase also and approximate to their
@c comparatively harmless angle of the Equilateral Triangle.
@c Thus, in the most brutal and formidable off the soldier class--
@c creatures almost on a level with women in their lack of intelligence--
@c it is found that, as they wax in the mental ability necessary
@c to employ their tremendous penetrating power to advantage,
@c so do they wane in the power of penetration itself.
@c 
@c How admirable is the Law of Compensation!  And how perfect
@c a proof of the natural fitness and, I may almost say,
@c the divine origin of the aristocratic constitution
@c of the States of Flatland!  By a judicious use of this
@c Law of Nature, the Polygons and Circles are almost always
@c able to stifle sedition in its very cradle, taking advantage
@c of the irrepressible and boundless hopefulness of the human mind.
@c Art also comes to the aid of Law and Order.  It is generally
@c found possible--by a little artificial compression or expansion
@c on the part of the State physicians--to make some of the more
@c intelligent leaders of a rebellion perfectly Regular,
@c and to admit them at once into the privileged classes;
@c a much larger number, who are still below the standard,
@c allured by the prospect of being ultimately ennobled,
@c are induced to enter the State Hospitals, where they
@c are kept in honourable confinement for life;
@c one or two alone of the most obstinate, foolish,
@c and hopelessly irregular are led to execution.
@c 
@c Then the wretched rabble of the Isosceles, planless
@c and leaderless, are ether transfixed without resistance
@c by the small body of their brethren whom the Chief Circle
@c keeps in pay for emergencies of this kind; or else more often,
@c by means of jealousies and suspicious skillfully fomented
@c among them by the Circular party, they are stirred to mutual warfare,
@c and perish by one another's angles.  No less than one hundred
@c and twenty rebellions are recorded in our annals, besides minor
@c outbreaks numbered at two hundred and thirty-five;
@c and they have all ended thus.

@c Footnote 1.
@c "What need of a certificate?" a Spaceland critic may ask: 
@c "Is not the procreation of a Square Son a certificate
@c from Nature herself, proving the Equal-sidedness of the Father?"
@c I reply that no Lady of any position will mary an uncertified Triangle.
@c Square offspring has sometimes resulted from a slightly Irregular Triangle;
@c but in almost every such case the Irregularity of the first generation
@c is visited on the third; which either fails to attain the Pentagonal rank,
@c or relapses to the Triangular.

@c 
@c SECTION 4  Concerning the Women
@c 
@c 
@c If our highly pointed Triangles of the Soldier class are formidable,
@c it may be readily inferred that far more formidable are our Women.
@c For, if a Soldier is a wedge, a Woman is a needle; being, so to speak,
@c ALL point, at least at the two extremities.  Add to this the power
@c of making herself practically invisible at will, and you will perceive
@c that a Female, in Flatland, is a creature by no means to be trifled with.
@c 
@c But here, perhaps, some of my younger Readers may ask HOW a woman
@c in Flatland can make herself invisible.  This ought, I think,
@c to be apparent without any explanation.  However, a few words
@c will make it clear to the most unreflecting.
@c 
@c Place a needle on the table.  Then, with your eye on the level of
@c the table, look at it side-ways, and you see the whole length of it;
@c but look at it end-ways, and you see nothing but a point,
@c it has become practically invisible.  Just so is it with one of our Women.
@c When her side is turned towards us, we see her as a straight line;
@c when the end containing her eye or mouth--for with us these
@c two organs are identical--is the part that meets our eye,
@c then we see nothing but a highly lustrous point;
@c but when the back is presented to our view,
@c then--being only sub-lustrous, and, indeed,
@c almost as dim as an inanimate object--her hinder
@c extremity serves her as a kind of Invisible Cap.
@c 
@c The dangers to which we are exposed from our Women must
@c now be manifest to the meanest capacity of Spaceland.
@c If even the angle of a respectable Triangle in the
@c middle class is not without its dangers;
@c if to run against a Working Man involves a gash;
@c if collision with an Officer of the military class
@c necessitates a serious wound; if a mere touch from
@c the vertex of a Private Soldier brings with it danger of death;
@c --what can it be to run against a woman, except absolute
@c and immediate destruction?  And when a Woman is invisible,
@c or visible only as a dim sub-lustrous point,
@c how difficult must it be, even for the most cautious,
@c always to avoid collision!
@c 
@c Many are the enactments made at different times in the different
@c States of Flatland, in order to minimize this peril;
@c and in the Southern and less temperate climates,
@c where the force of gravitation is greater,
@c and human beings more liable to casual
@c and involuntary motions, the Laws concerning
@c Women are naturally much more stringent.
@c But a general view of the Code may be obtained
@c from the following summary:--
@c 
@c 1.  Every house shall have one entrance on the Eastern side,
@c for the use of Females only; by which all females shall enter
@c "in a becoming and respectful manner" (footnote 1) and not
@c by the Men's or Western door.
@c 
@c 2.  No Female shall walk in any public place without continually
@c keeping up her Peace-cry, under penalty of death.
@c 
@c 3.  Any Female, duly certified to be suffering from
@c St. Vitus's Dance, fits, chronic cold accompanied
@c by violent sneezing, or any disease necessitating
@c involuntary motions, shall be instantly destroyed.
@c 
@c In some of the States there is an additional Law
@c forbidding Females, under penalty of death,
@c from walking or standing in any public place
@c without moving their backs constantly from
@c right to left so as to indicate their presence
@c to those behind them; other oblige a Woman,
@c when travelling, to be followed by one of her sons,
@c or servants, or by her husband; others confine
@c Women altogether in their houses except during
@c the religious festivals.  But it has been found
@c by the wisest of our Circles or Statesmen
@c that the multiplication of restrictions on Females
@c tends not only to the debilitation and diminution
@c of the race, but also to the increase of domestic
@c murders to such an extent that a State loses
@c more than it gains by a too prohibitive Code.
@c 
@c For whenever the temper of the Women is thus exasperated
@c by confinement at home or hampering regulations abroad,
@c they are apt to vent their spleen upon their husbands and children;
@c and in the less temperate climates the whole male population
@c of a village has been sometimes destroyed in one or two hours
@c of a simultaneous female outbreak.  Hence the Three Laws,
@c mentioned above, suffice for the better regulated States,
@c and may be accepted as a rough exemplification of our Female Code.
@c 
@c After all, our principal safeguard is found, not in Legislature,
@c but in the interests of the Women themselves.  For, although they
@c can inflict instantaneous death by a retrograde movement,
@c yet unless they can at once disengage their stinging extremity
@c from the struggling body of their victim, their own frail bodies
@c are liable to be shattered.
@c 
@c The power of Fashion is also on our side.  I pointed out that
@c in some less civilized States no female is suffered to stand
@c in any public place without swaying her back from right to left.
@c This practice has been universal among ladies of any pretensions
@c to breeding in all well-governed States, as far back as the memory
@c of Figures can reach.  It is considered a disgrace to any state
@c that legislation should have to enforce what ought to be,
@c and is in every respectable female, a natural instinct.
@c The rhythmical and, if I may so say, well-modulated undulation
@c of the back in our ladies of Circular rank is envied and imitated
@c by the wife of a common Equilateral, who can achieve nothing beyond
@c a mere monotonous swing, like the ticking of a pendulum;
@c and the regular tick of the Equilateral is no less admired
@c and copied by the wife of the progressive and aspiring Isosceles,
@c in the females of whose family no "back-motion" of any kind
@c has become as yet a necessity of life.  Hence, in every family
@c of position and consideration, "back motion" is as prevalent
@c as time itself; and the husbands and sons in these households
@c enjoy immunity at least from invisible attacks.
@c 
@c Not that it must be for a moment supposed that our Women are
@c destitute of affection.  But unfortunately the passion of the
@c moment predominates, in the Frail Sex, over every other consideration.
@c This is, of course, a necessity arising from their unfortunate
@c conformation.  For as they have no pretensions to an angle,
@c being inferior in this respect to the very lowest of the Isosceles,
@c they are consequently wholly devoid of brainpower, and have
@c neither reflection, judgment nor forethought, and hardly any memory.
@c Hence, in their fits of fury, they remember no claims and recognize
@c no distinctions.  I have actually known a case where a Woman
@c has exterminated her whole household, and half an hour afterwards,
@c when her rage was over and the fragments swept away,
@c has asked what has become of her husband and children.
@c 
@c Obviously then a Woman is not to be irritated as long as she
@c is in a position where she can turn round.  When you have them
@c in their apartments--which are constructed with a view
@c to denying them that power--you can say and do what you like;
@c for they are then wholly impotent for mischief, and will
@c not remember a few minutes hence the incident for which
@c they may be at this moment threatening you with death,
@c nor the promises which you may have found it necessary
@c to make in order to pacify their fury.
@c 
@c On the whole we got on pretty smoothly in our domestic relations,
@c except in the lower strata of the Military Classes.  There the want
@c of tact and discretion on the part of the husbands produces at times
@c indescribable disasters.  Relying too much on the offensive weapons
@c of their acute angles instead of the defensive organs of good sense
@c and seasonable simulations, these reckless creatures too often neglect
@c the prescribed construction of the women's apartments, or irritate
@c their wives by ill-advised expressions out of doors, which they
@c refuse immediately to retract.  Moreover a blunt and stolid regard
@c for literal truth indisposes them to make those lavish promises
@c by which the more judicious Circle can in a moment pacify his consort.
@c The result is massacre; not, however, without its advantages,
@c as it eliminates the more brutal and troublesome of the Isosceles;
@c and by many of our Circles the destructiveness of the Thinner Sex
@c is regarded as one among many providential arrangements for suppressing
@c redundant population, and nipping Revolution in the bud.
@c 
@c Yet even in our best regulated and most approximately Circular
@c families I cannot say that the ideal of family life is so high
@c as with you in Spaceland.  There is peace, in so far as the absence
@c of slaughter may be called by that name, but there is necessarily
@c little harmony of tastes or pursuits; and the cautious wisdom
@c of the Circles has ensured safety at the cost of domestic comfort.
@c In every Circular or Polygonal household it has been a habit
@c from time immemorial--and now has become a kind of instinct
@c among the women of our higher classes--that the mothers and daughters
@c should constantly keep their eyes and mouths towards their husband
@c and his male friends; and for a lady in a family of distinction
@c to turn her back upon her husband would be regarded as a kind of portent,
@c involving loss of STATUS.  But, as I shall soon shew, this custom,
@c though it has the advantage of safety, is not without disadvantages.
@c 
@c In the house of the Working Man or respectable Tradesman--where the
@c wife is allowed to turn her back upon her husband, while pursuing
@c her household avocations--there are at least intervals of quiet,
@c when the wife is neither seen nor heard, except for the humming sound
@c of the continuous Peace-cry; but in the homes of the upper classes
@c there is too often no peace.  There the voluble mouth and bright
@c penetrating eye are ever directed toward the Master of the household;
@c and light itself is not more persistent than the stream of Feminine
@c discourse.  The tact and skill which suffice to avert a Woman's sting
@c are unequal to the task of stopping a Woman's mouth; and as the wife
@c has absolutely nothing to say, and absolutely no constraint of wit,
@c sense, or conscience to prevent her from saying it, not a few cynics
@c have been found to aver that they prefer the danger of the death-dealing
@c but inaudible sting to the safe sonorousness of a Woman's other end.
@c 
@c To my readers in Spaceland the condition of our Women may seen
@c truly deplorable, and so indeed it is.  A Male of the lowest type
@c of the Isosceles may look forward to some improvement of his angle,
@c and to the ultimate elevation of the whole of his degraded caste;
@c but no Woman can entertain such hopes for her sex.  "Once a Woman,
@c always a Woman" is a Decree of Nature; and the very Laws of Evolution
@c seem suspended in her disfavour.  Yet at least we can admire the wise
@c Prearrangement which has ordained that, as they have no hopes, so they
@c shall have no memory to recall, and no forethought to anticipate,
@c the miseries and humiliations which are at once a necessity of their
@c existence and the basis of the constitution of Flatland.
@c 
@c 
@c 
@c 
@c SECTION 5  Of our Methods of Recognizing one another
@c 
@c 
@c You, who are blessed with shade as well as light, you, who are
@c gifted with two eyes, endowed with a knowledge of perspective,
@c and charmed with the enjoyment of various colours, you, who can
@c actually SEE an angle, and contemplate the complete circumference
@c of a Circle in the happy region of the Three Dimensions--
@c how shall I make it clear to you the extreme difficulty which we
@c in Flatland experience in recognizing one another's configuration?
@c 
@c Recall what I told you above.  All beings in Flatland, animate and
@c inanimate, no matter what their form, present TO OUR VIEW the same,
@c or nearly the same, appearance, viz. that of a straight Line.  How then
@c can one be distinguished from another, where all appear the same?
@c 
@c The answer is threefold.  The first means of recognition is the sense
@c of hearing; which with us is far more highly developed than with you,
@c and which enables us not only to distinguish by the voice of our
@c personal friends, but even to discriminate between different classes,
@c at least so far as concerns the three lowest orders, the Equilateral,
@c the Square, and the Pentagon--for the Isosceles I take no account.
@c But as we ascend the social scale, the process of discriminating
@c and being discriminated by hearing increases in difficulty, partly because
@c voices are assimilated, partly because the faculty of voice-discrimination
@c is a plebeian virtue not much developed among the Aristocracy.  And wherever
@c there is any danger of imposture we cannot trust to this method.
@c Amongst our lowest orders, the vocal organs are developed to a degree
@c more than correspondent with those of hearing, so that an Isosceles
@c can easily feign the voice of a Polygon, and, with some training,
@c that of a Circle himself.  A second method is therefore more
@c commonly resorted to.
@c 
@c FEELING is, among our Women and lower classes--about our upper
@c classes I shall speak presently--the principal test of recognition,
@c at all events between strangers, and when the question is, not as to
@c the individual, but as to the class.  What therefore "introduction"
@c is among the higher classes in Spaceland, that the process of "feeling"
@c is with us.  "Permit me to ask you to feel and be felt by my friend
@c Mr. So-and-so"--is still, among the more old-fashioned of our
@c country gentlemen in districts remote from towns, the customary
@c formula for a Flatland introduction.  But in the towns, and among men
@c of business, the words "be felt by" are omitted and the sentence is
@c abbreviated to, "Let me ask you to feel Mr. So-and-so"; although it is
@c assumed, of course, that the "feeling" is to be reciprocal.  Among our
@c still more modern and dashing young gentlemen--who are extremely
@c averse to superfluous effort and supremely indifferent to the
@c purity of their native language--the formula is still further
@c curtailed by the use of "to feel" in a technical sense, meaning,
@c "to recommend-for- the-purposes-of-feeling-and-being-felt";
@c and at this moment the "slang" of polite or fast society
@c in the upper classes sanctions such a barbarism as "Mr. Smith,
@c permit me to feel Mr. Jones."
@c 
@c Let not my Reader however suppose that "feeling" is with us
@c the tedious process that it would be with you, or that we find
@c it necessary to feel right round all the sides of every individual
@c before we determine the class to which he belongs.  Long practice
@c and training, begun in the schools and continued in the experience
@c of daily life, enable us to discriminate at once by the sense of touch,
@c between the angles of an equal-sided Triangle, Square, and Pentagon;
@c and I need not say that the brainless vertex of an acute-angled
@c Isosceles is obvious to the dullest touch.  It is therefore
@c not necessary, as a rule, to do more than feel a single angle
@c of an individual; and this, once ascertained, tells us the class
@c of the person whom we are addressing, unless indeed he belongs to the
@c higher sections of the nobility.  There the difficulty is much greater.
@c Even a Master of Arts in our University of Wentbridge has been known
@c to confuse a ten-sided with a twelve-sided Polygon; and there is hardly
@c a Doctor of Science in or out of that famous University who could
@c pretend to decide promptly and unhesitatingly between a twenty-sided
@c and a twenty-four sided member of the Aristocracy.
@c 
@c Those of my readers who recall the extracts I gave above from the
@c Legislative code concerning Women, will readily perceive that the
@c process of introduction by contact requires some care and discretion. 
@c Otherwise the angles might inflict on the unwary Feeling irreparable
@c injury.  It is essential for the safety of the Feeler that the Felt
@c should stand perfectly still.  A start, a fidgety shifting
@c of the position, yes, even a violent sneeze, has been known before
@c now to prove fatal to the incautious, and to nip in the bud many
@c a promising friendship.  Especially is this true among the lower classes
@c of the Triangles.  With them, the eye is situated so far from their vertex
@c that they can scarcely take cognizance of what goes on at that extremity
@c of their frame.  They are, moreover, of a rough coarse nature, not sensitive
@c to the delicate touch of the highly organized Polygon.  What wonder then
@c if an involuntary toss of the head has ere now deprived the State
@c of a valuable life!
@c 
@c I have heard that my excellent Grandfather--one of the least
@c irregular of his unhappy Isosceles class, who indeed obtained,
@c shortly before his decease, four out of seven votes from the Sanitary
@c and Social Board for passing him into the class of the Equal-sided--
@c often deplored, with a tear in his venerable eye, a miscarriage of
@c this kind, which had occurred to his great-great-great-Grandfather,
@c a respectable Working Man with an angle or brain of 59 degrees
@c 30 minutes.  According to his account, my unfortunately Ancestor,
@c being afflicted with rheumatism, and in the act of being felt
@c by a Polygon, by one sudden start accidentally transfixed
@c the Great Man through the diagonal and thereby, partly in consequence
@c of his long imprisonment and degradation, and partly because
@c of the moral shock which pervaded the whole of my Ancestor's relations,
@c threw back our family a degree and a half in their ascent towards
@c better things.  The result was that in the next generation
@c the family brain was registered at only 58 degrees,
@c and not till the lapse of five generations was the lost
@c ground recovered, the full 60 degrees attained,
@c and the Ascent from the Isosceles finally achieved.
@c And all this series of calamities from one little accident
@c in the process of Feeling.
@c 
@c As this point I think I hear some of my better educated readers exclaim,
@c "How could you in Flatland know anything about angles and degrees,
@c or minutes?  We SEE an angle, because we, in the region of Space,
@c can see two straight lines inclined to one another; but you,
@c who can see nothing but on straight line at a time, or at all events
@c only a number of bits of straight lines all in one straight line,--
@c how can you ever discern an angle, and much less register angles
@c of different sizes?"
@c 
@c I answer that though we cannot SEE angles, we can INFER them, and this
@c with great precision.  Our sense of touch, stimulated by necessity,
@c and developed by long training, enables us to distinguish angles
@c far more accurately than your sense of sight, when unaided by a rule
@c or measure of angles.  nor must I omit to explain that we have great
@c natural helps.  It is with us a Law of Nature that the brain
@c of the Isosceles class shall begin at half a degree,
@c or thirty minutes, and shall increase (if it increases at all)
@c by half a degree in every generation until the goal of 60 degrees
@c is reached, when the condition of serfdom is quitted, and the freeman
@c enters the class of Regulars.
@c 
@c Consequently, Nature herself supplies us with an ascending scale
@c or Alphabet of angles for half a degree up to 60 degrees, Specimen
@c of which are placed in every Elementary School throughout the land. 
@c Owing to occasional retrogressions, to still more frequent moral
@c and intellectual stagnation, and to the extraordinary fecundity
@c of the Criminal and Vagabond classes, there is always a vast superfluity
@c of individuals of the half degree and single degree class, and a fair
@c abundance of Specimens up to 10 degrees.  These are absolutely
@c destitute of civil rights; and a great number of them, not having
@c even intelligence enough for the purposes of warfare, are devoted
@c by the States to the service of education.  Fettered immovably
@c so as to remove all possibility of danger, they are placed
@c in the classrooms of our Infant Schools, and there they are utilized
@c by the Board of Education for the purpose of imparting to the offspring
@c of the Middle Classes the tact and intelligence which these wretched
@c creatures themselves are utterly devoid.
@c 
@c In some States the Specimens are occasionally fed and suffered
@c to exist for several years; but in the more temperate and better
@c regulated regions, it is found in the long run more advantageous
@c for the educational interests of the young, to dispense with food,
@c and to renew the Specimens every month--which is about the average
@c duration of the foodless existence of the Criminal class.
@c In the cheaper schools, what is gained by the longer existence
@c of the Specimen is lost, partly in the expenditure for food,
@c and partly in the diminished accuracy of the angles, which
@c are impaired after a few weeks of constant "feeling."
@c Nor must we forget to add, in enumerating the advantages
@c of the more expensive system, that it tends, though slightly
@c yet perceptibly, to the diminution of the redundant Isosceles population--
@c an object which every statesman in Flatland constantly keeps in view.
@c On the whole therefore--although I am not ignorant that,
@c in many popularly elected School Boards, there is a reaction
@c in favour of "the cheap system" as it is called--
@c I am myself disposed to think that this is one
@c of the many cases in which expense is the truest economy.
@c 
@c But I must not allow questions of School Board politics to divert
@c me from my subject.  Enough has been said, I trust, to shew that
@c Recognition by Feeling is not so tedious or indecisive a process
@c as might have been supposed; and it is obviously more trustworthy
@c than Recognition by hearing.  Still there remains, as has been pointed
@c out above, the objection that this method is not without danger.
@c For this reason many in the Middle and Lower classes, and all
@c without exception in the Polygonal and Circular orders,
@c prefer a third method, the description of which
@c shall be reserved for the next section.
@c 
@c 
@c 
@c 
@c SECTION 6  Of Recognition by Sight
@c 
@c 
@c I am about to appear very inconsistent.  In the previous sections
@c I have said that all figures in Flatland present the appearance
@c of a straight line; and it was added or implied, that it is consequently
@c impossible to distinguish by the visual organ between individuals
@c of different classes:  yet now I am about to explain to my Spaceland
@c critics how we are able to recognize one another by the sense of sight.
@c 
@c If however the Reader will take the trouble to refer to the passage
@c in which Recognition by Feeling is stated to be universal,
@c he will find this qualification--"among the lower classes."
@c It is only among the higher classes and in our more temperate
@c climates that Sight Recognition is practised.
@c 
@c That this power exists in any regions and for any classes is the result
@c of Fog; which prevails during the greater part of the year in all parts
@c save the torrid zones.  That which is with you in Spaceland an unmixed evil,
@c blotting out the landscape, depressing the spirits, and enfeebling the health,
@c is by us recognized as a blessing scarcely inferior to air itself, and as the
@c Nurse of arts and Parent of sciences.  But let me explain my meaning,
@c without further eulogies on this beneficent Element.
@c 
@c If Fog were non-existent, all lines would appear equally
@c and indistinguishably clear; and this is actually the case
@c in those unhappy countries in which the atmosphere is perfectly
@c dry and transparent.  But wherever there is a rich supply of Fog,
@c objects that are at a distance, say of three feet, are appreciably
@c dimmer than those at the distance of two feet eleven inches; and the
@c result is that by careful and constant experimental observation
@c of comparative dimness and clearness, we are enabled to infer
@c with great exactness the configuration of the object observed.
@c 
@c An instance will do more than a volume of generalities to make
@c my meaning clear.
@c 
@c Suppose I see two individuals approaching whose rank I wish to ascertain.
@c They are, we will suppose, a Merchant and a Physician, or in other words,
@c an Equilateral Triangle and a Pentagon; how am I to distinguish them?
@c 
@c It will be obvious, to every child in Spaceland who has touched
@c the threshold of Geometrical Studies, that, if I can bring my eye
@c so that its glance may bisect an angle (A) of the approaching stranger,
@c my view will lie as it were evenly between the two sides that are next
@c to me (viz. CA and AB), so that I shall contemplate the two impartially,
@c and both will appear of the same size.
@c 
@c Now in the case of (1) the Merchant, what shall I see?  I shall see
@c a straight line DAE, in which the middle point (A) will be very bright
@c because it is nearest to me; but on either side the line will shade
@c away RAPIDLY TO DIMNESS, because the sides AC and AB RECEDE RAPIDLY
@c INTO THE FOG and what appear to me as the Merchant's extremities,
@c viz. D and E, will be VERY DIM INDEED.
@c 
@c On the other hand in the case of (2) the Physician, though I shall
@c here also see a line (D'A'E') with a bright centre (A'), yet it will
@c shade away LESS RAPIDLY to dimness, because the sides (A'C', A'B')
@c RECEDE LESS RAPIDLY INTO THE FOG:  and what appear to me the Physician's
@c extremities, viz. D' and E', will not be NOT SO DIM as the extremities
@c of the Merchant.
@c 
@c The Reader will probably understand from these two instances how
@c --after a very long training supplemented by constant experience--
@c it is possible for the well-educated classes among us to discriminate
@c with fair accuracy between the middle and lowest orders, by the sense
@c of sight.  If my Spaceland Patrons have grasped this general conception,
@c so far as to conceive the possibility of it and not to reject my account
@c as altogether incredible--I shall have attained all I can reasonably expect.
@c Were I to attempt further details I should only perplex.  Yet for the sake
@c of the young and inexperienced, who may perchance infer--from the two simple
@c instances I have given above, of the manner in which I should recognize
@c my Father and my Sons--that Recognition by sight is an easy affair,
@c it may be needful to point out that in actual life most of the problems
@c of Sight Recognition are far more subtle and complex.
@c 
@c If for example, when my Father, the Triangle, approaches me,
@c he happens to present his side to me instead of his angle, then,
@c until I have asked him to rotate, or until I have edged my eye around him,
@c I am for the moment doubtful whether he may not be a Straight Line, or,
@c in other words, a Woman.  Again, when I am in the company of one of my
@c two hexagonal Grandsons, contemplating one of his sides (AB) full front,
@c it will be evident from the accompanying diagram that I shall see one whole
@c line (AB) in comparative brightness (shading off hardly at all at the ends)
@c and two smaller lines (CA and BD) dim throughout and shading away into greater
@c dimness towards the extremities C and D.
@c 
@c But I must not give way to the temptation of enlarging on these topics.
@c The meanest mathematician in Spaceland will readily believe me when
@c I assert that the problems of life, which present themselves to the
@c well-educated--when they are themselves in motion, rotating,
@c advancing or retreating, and at the same time attempting
@c to discriminate by the sense of sight between a number of Polygons
@c of high rank moving in different directions, as for example in a
@c ball-room or conversazione--must be of a nature to task the angularity
@c of the most intellectual, and amply justify the rich endowments
@c of the Learned Professors of Geometry, both Static and Kinetic,
@c in the illustrious University of Wentbridge, where the Science
@c and Art of Sight Recognition are regularly taught to large classes
@c of the ELITE of the States.
@c 
@c It is only a few of the scions of our noblest and wealthiest houses,
@c who are able to give the time and money necessary for the thorough
@c prosecution of this noble and valuable Art.  Even to me, a Mathematician
@c of no mean standing, and the Grandfather of two most hopeful and perfectly
@c regular Hexagons, to find myself in the midst of a crowd of rotating Polygons
@c of the higher classes, is occasionally very perplexing.  And of course
@c to a common Tradesman, or Serf, such a sight is almost as unintelligible
@c as it would be to you, my Reader, were you suddenly transported to my country.
@c 
@c In such a crowd you could see on all sides of you nothing but a Line,
@c apparently straight, but of which the parts would vary irregularly
@c and perpetually in brightness or dimness.  Even if you had completed
@c your third year in the Pentagonal and Hexagonal classes in the University,
@c and were perfect in the theory of the subject, you would still find there
@c was need of many years of experience, before you could move in a fashionable
@c crowd without jostling against your betters, whom it is against etiquette
@c to ask to "feel," and who, by their superior culture and breeding,
@c know all about your movements, while you know very little or nothing
@c about theirs.  in a word, to comport oneself with perfect propriety
@c in Polygonal society, one ought to be a Polygon oneself.
@c Such at least is the painful teaching of my experience.
@c 
@c It is astonishing how much the Art--or I may almost call it instinct--
@c of Sight Recognition is developed by the habitual practice of it
@c and by the avoidance of the custom of "Feeling."  Just as, with you,
@c the deaf and dumb, if once allowed to gesticulate and to use the hand-alphabet,
@c will never acquire the more difficult but far more valuable art of lip-speech
@c and lip-reading, so it is with us as regards "Seeing" and "Feeling."
@c None who in early life resort to "Feeling" will ever learn "Seeing"
@c in perfection.
@c 
@c For this reason, among our Higher Classes, "Feeling" is discouraged
@c or absolutely forbidden.  From the cradle their children, instead of going
@c to the Public Elementary schools (where the art of Feeling is taught,)
@c are sent to higher Seminaries of an exclusive character; and at our
@c illustrious University, to "feel" is regarded as a most serious fault,
@c involving Rustication for the first offence, and Expulsion for the second.
@c 
@c But among the lower classes the art of Sight Recognition is regarded
@c as an unattainable luxury.  A common Tradesman cannot afford to let
@c his sun spend a third of his life in abstract studies.  The children
@c of the poor are therefore allowed to "feel" from their earliest years,
@c and they gain thereby a precocity and an early vivacity which contrast
@c at first most favourably with the inert, undeveloped, and listless
@c behaviour of the half-instructed youths of the Polygonal class;
@c but when the latter have at last completed their University course,
@c and are prepared to put their theory into practice, the change
@c that comes over them may almost be described as a new birth,
@c and in every art, science, and social pursuit they rapidly
@c overtake and distance their Triangular competitors.
@c 
@c Only a few of the Polygonal Class fail to pass the Final Test
@c or Leaving Examination at the University.  The condition of the
@c unsuccessful minority is truly pitiable.  Rejected from the higher
@c class,, they are also despised by the lower.  They have neither the
@c matured and systematically trained powers of the Polygonal Bachelors
@c and Masters of Arts, nor yet the native precocity and mercurial
@c versatility of the youthful Tradesman.  The professions, the public
@c services, are closed against them, and though in most States they
@c are not actually debarred from marriage, yet they have the greatest
@c difficulty in forming suitable alliances, as experience shews that
@c the offspring of such unfortunate and ill-endowed parents is generally
@c itself unfortunate, if not positively Irregular.
@c 
@c It is from these specimens of the refuse of our Nobility that the great
@c Tumults and Seditions of past ages have generally derived their leaders;
@c and so great is the mischief thence arising that an increasing minority
@c of our more progressive Statesmen are of opinion that true mercy would
@c dictate their entire suppression, by enacting that all who fail to pass
@c the Final Examination of the University should be either imprisoned
@c for life, or extinguished by a painless death.
@c 
@c But I find myself digressing into the subject of Irregularities,
@c a matter of such vital interest that it demands a separate section.
@c 
@c 
@c 
@c 
@c 
@c SECTION 7  Concerning Irregular Figures
@c 
@c 
@c Throughout the previous pages I have been assuming--what perhaps
@c should have been laid down at the beginning as a distinct and
@c fundamental proposition--that every human being in Flatland
@c is a Regular Figure, that is to say of regular construction.
@c By this I mean that a Woman must not only be a line, but a straight line;
@c that an Artisan or Soldier must have two of his sides equal;
@c that Tradesmen must have three sides equal; Lawyers (of which class
@c I am a humble member), four sides equal, and, generally,
@c that in every Polygon, all the sides must be equal.
@c 
@c The sizes of the sides would of course depend upon the age of
@c the individual.  A Female at birth would be about an inch long,
@c while a tall adult Woman might extend to a foot.  As to the Males
@c of every class, it may be roughly said that the length of an adult's size,
@c when added together, is two feet or a little more.  But the size of our sides
@c is not under consideration.  I am speaking of the EQUALITY of sides,
@c and it does not need much reflection to see that the whole of the
@c social life in Flatland rests upon the fundamental fact that
@c Nature wills all Figures to have their sides equal.
@c 
@c If our sides were unequal our angles might be unequal.  Instead of
@c its being sufficient to feel, or estimate by sight, a single angle
@c in order to determine the form of an individual, it would be necessary
@c to ascertain each angle by the experiment of Feeling.  But life would
@c be too short for such a tedious groping.  The whole science and art
@c of Sight Recognition would at once perish; Feeling, so far as it is
@c an art, would not long survive; intercourse would become perilous
@c or impossible; there would be an end to all confidence, all forethought;
@c no one would be safe in making the most simple social arrangements;
@c in a word, civilization might relapse into barbarism.
@c 
@c Am I going too fast to carry my Readers with me to these obvious conclusions?
@c Surely a moment's reflection, and a single instance from common life,
@c must convince every one that our social system is based upon Regularity,
@c or Equality of Angles.  You meet, for example, two or three Tradesmen
@c in the street, whom your recognize at once to be Tradesman by a glance
@c at their angles and rapidly bedimmed sides, and you ask them to step into
@c your house to lunch.  This you do at present with perfect confidence,
@c because everyone knows to an inch or two the area occupied by
@c an adult Triangle: but imagine that your Tradesman drags behind
@c his regular and respectable vertex, a parallelogram of twelve
@c or thirteen inches in diagonal:--what are you to do with such
@c a monster sticking fast in your house door?
@c 
@c But I am insulting the intelligence of my Readers by accumulating
@c details which must be patent to everyone who enjoys the advantages
@c of a Residence in Spaceland.  Obviously the measurements of a single
@c angle would no longer be sufficient under such portentous circumstances;
@c one's whole life would be taken up in feeling or surveying the perimeter
@c of one's acquaintances.  Already the difficulties of avoiding a collision
@c in a crowd are enough to tax the sagacity of even a well-educated Square;
@c but if no one could calculate the Regularity of a single figure in the company,
@c all would be chaos and confusion, and the slightest panic would cause
@c serious injuries, or--if there happened to be any Women or Soldiers present--
@c perhaps considerable loss of life.
@c 
@c Expediency therefore concurs with Nature in stamping the seal
@c of its approval upon Regularity of conformation:  nor has the Law
@c been backward in seconding their efforts.  "Irregularity of Figure"
@c means with us the same as, or more than, a combination of moral obliquity
@c and criminality with you, and is treated accordingly.  There are not
@c wanting, it is true, some promulgators of paradoxes who maintain that
@c there is no necessary connection between geometrical and moral Irregularity.
@c "The Irregular," they say, "is from his birth scouted by his own parents,
@c derided by his brothers and sisters, neglected by the domestics,
@c scorned and suspected by society, and excluded from all posts
@c of responsibility, trust, and useful activity.  His every
@c movement is jealously watched by the police till he comes
@c of age and presents himself for inspection; then he is either destroyed,
@c if he is found to exceed the fixed margin of deviation, at an uninteresting
@c occupation for a miserable stipend; obliged to live and board at the office,
@c and to take even his vacation under close supervision; what wonder that
@c human nature, even in the best and purest, is embittered and perverted
@c by such surroundings!"
@c 
@c All this very plausible reasoning does not convince me, as it has not
@c convinced the wisest of our Statesmen, that our ancestors erred in laying
@c it down as an axiom of policy that the toleration of Irregularity
@c is incompatible with the safety of the State.  Doubtless, the life
@c of an Irregular is hard; but the interests of the Greater Number
@c require that it shall be hard.  If a man with a triangular front
@c and a polygonal back were allowed to exist and to propagate a still
@c more Irregular posterity, what would become of the arts of life?
@c Are the houses and doors and churches in Flatland to be altered
@c in order to accommodate such monsters?  Are our ticket-collectors
@c to be required to measure every man's perimeter before they allow
@c him to enter a theatre, or to take his place in a lecture room?
@c Is an Irregular to be exempted from the militia?  And if not,
@c how is he to be prevented from carrying desolation into the ranks
@c of his comrades?  Again, what irresistible temptations to fraudulent
@c impostures must needs beset such a creature!  How easy for him to enter
@c a shop with his polygonal front foremost, and to order goods to any extent
@c from a confiding tradesman!  Let the advocates of a falsely called
@c Philanthropy plead as they may for the abrogation of the Irregular Penal Laws,
@c I for my part have never known an Irregular who was not also what Nature
@c evidently intended him to be--a hypocrite, a misanthropist, and,
@c up to the limits of his power, a perpetrator of all manner of mischief.
@c 
@c Not that I should be disposed to recommend (at present)
@c the extreme measures adopted by some States, where an infant
@c whose angle deviates by half a degree from the correct angularity
@c is summarily destroyed at birth. Some of our highest and ablest men,
@c men of real genius, have during their earliest days laboured under
@c deviations as great as, or even greater than forty-five minutes:
@c and the loss of their precious lives would have been an irreparable
@c injury to the State.  The art of healing also has achieved some
@c of its most glorious triumphs in the compressions, extensions,
@c trepannings, colligations, and other surgical or diaetetic
@c operations by which Irregularity has been partly or wholly cured.
@c Advocating therefore a VIA MEDIA, I would lay down no fixed
@c or absolute line of demarcation; but at the period when the frame
@c is just beginning to set, and when the Medical Board has reported
@c that recovery is improbably, I would suggest that the Irregular
@c offspring be painlessly and mercifully consumed.

@c 
@c SECTION 8  Of the Ancient Practice of Painting
@c 
@c 
@c If my Readers have followed me with any attention up to this point,
@c they will not be surprised to hear that life is somewhat dull in Flatland.
@c I do not, of course, mean that there are not battles, conspiracies,
@c tumults, factions, and all those other phenomena which are supposed
@c to make History interesting; nor would I deny that the strange mixture
@c of the problems of life and the problems of Mathematics, continually
@c inducing conjecture and giving an opportunity of immediate verification,
@c imparts to our existence a zest which you in Spaceland can hardly comprehend.
@c I speak now from the aesthetic and artistic point of view when I say that life
@c with us is dull; aesthetically and artistically, very dull indeed.
@c 
@c How can it be otherwise, when all one's prospect, all one's landscapes,
@c historical pieces, portraits, flowers, still life, are nothing but
@c a single line, with no varieties except degrees of brightness and obscurity?
@c 
@c It was not always thus.  Colour, if Tradition speaks the truth,
@c once for the space of half a dozen centuries or more, threw a transient
@c splendour over the lives of our ancestors in the remotest ages.
@c Some private individual--a Pentagon whose name is variously reported--
@c having casually discovered the constituents of the simpler colours
@c and a rudimentary method of painting, is said to have begun by decorating
@c first his house, then his slaves, then his Father, his Sons, and Grandsons,
@c lastly himself.  The convenience as well as the beauty of the results
@c commended themselves to all.  Wherever Chromatistes,--for by that name
@c the most trustworthy authorities concur in calling him,--turned his
@c variegated frame, there he at once excited attention, and attracted respect.
@c No one now needed to "feel" him; no one mistook his front for his back;
@c all his movements were readily ascertained by his neighbours without
@c the slightest strain on their powers of calculation; no one jostled him,
@c or failed to make way for him; his voice was saved the labour
@c of that exhausting utterance by which we colourless Squares
@c and Pentagons are often forced to proclaim our individuality
@c when we move amid a crowd of ignorant Isosceles.
@c 
@c The fashion spread like wildfire.  Before a week was over,
@c every Square and Triangle in the district had copied the example
@c of Chromatistes, and only a few of the more conservative Pentagons
@c still held out.  A month or two found even the Dodecagons infected
@c with the innovation.  A year had not elapsed before the habit
@c had spread to all but the very highest of the Nobility.
@c Needless to say, the custom soon made its way from the district
@c of Chromatistes to surrounding regions; and within two generations
@c no one in all Flatland was colourless except the Women and the Priests.
@c 
@c Here Nature herself appeared to erect a barrier, and to plead
@c against extending the innovations to these two classes.  Many-
@c sidedness was almost essential as a pretext for the Innovators. 
@c "Distinction of sides is intended by Nature to imply distinction
@c of colours"--such was the sophism which in those days flew from
@c mouth to mouth, converting whole towns at a time to a new culture.
@c But manifestly to our Priests and Women this adage did not apply.
@c The latter had only one side, and therefore--plurally and pedantically
@c speaking--NO SIDES.  The former--if at least they would assert their
@c claim to be readily and truly Circles, and not mere high-class Polygons,
@c with an infinitely large number of infinitesimally small sides--
@c were in the habit of boasting (what Women confessed and deplored)
@c that they also had no sides, being blessed with a perimeter
@c of only one line, or, in other words, a Circumference.
@c Hence it came to pass that these two Classes could see
@c no force in the so-called axiom about "Distinction of Sides
@c implying Distinction of Colour;" and when all others
@c had succumbed to the fascinations of corporal decoration,
@c the Priests and the Women alone still remained pure
@c from the pollution of paint.
@c 
@c Immoral, licentious, anarchical, unscientific--call them by what names
@c you will--yet, from an aesthetic point of view, those ancient days
@c of the Colour Revolt were the glorious childhood of Art in Flatland--
@c a childhood, alas, that never ripened into manhood, nor even reached
@c the blossom of youth.  To live then in itself a delight, because living
@c implied seeing.  Even at a small party, the company was a pleasure to behold;
@c the richly varied hues of the assembly in a church or theatre are said
@c to have more than once proved too distracting from our greatest teachers
@c and actors; but most ravishing of all is said to have been the unspeakable
@c magnificence of a military review.
@c 
@c The sight of a line of battle of twenty thousand Isosceles suddenly
@c facing about, and exchanging the sombre black of their bases for the
@c orange of the two sides including their acute angle; the militia
@c of the Equilateral Triangles tricoloured in red, white, and blue;
@c the mauve, ultra-marine, gamboge, and burnt umber of the Square
@c artillerymen rapidly rotating near their vermillion guns;
@c the dashing and flashing of the five-coloured and six-coloured
@c Pentagons and Hexagons careering across the field in their
@c offices of surgeons, geometricians and aides-de-camp--all
@c these may well have been sufficient to render credible the
@c famous story how an illustrious Circle, overcome by the artistic
@c beauty of the forces under his command, threw aside
@c his marshal's baton and his royal crown, exclaiming
@c that he henceforth exchanged them for the artist's pencil. 
@c How great and glorious the sensuous development of these days must
@c have been is in part indicated by the very language and vocabulary
@c of the period.  The commonest utterances of the commonest citizens
@c in the time of the Colour Revolt seem to have been suffused with a richer
@c tinge of word or thought; and to that era we are even now indebted
@c for our finest poetry and for whatever rhythm still remains in the more
@c scientific utterance of those modern days.
@c 
@c 
@c 
@c 
@c SECTION 9  Of the Universal Colour Bill
@c 
@c 
@c But meanwhile the intellectual Arts were fast decaying.
@c 
@c The Art of Sight Recognition, being no longer needed, was
@c no longer practised; and the studies of Geometry, Statics, Kinetics,
@c and other kindred subjects, came soon to be considered superfluous,
@c and feel into disrespect and neglect even at our University.
@c The inferior Art of Feeling speedily experienced the same fate
@c at our Elementary Schools.  Then the Isosceles classes,
@c asserting that the Specimens were no longer used nor needed,
@c and refusing to pay the customary tribute from the Criminal classes
@c to the service of Education, waxed daily more numerous and more insolent
@c on the strength of their immunity from the old burden which had formerly
@c exercised the twofold wholesome effect of at once taming their brutal
@c nature and thinning their excessive numbers.
@c 
@c Year by year the Soldiers and Artisans began more vehemently
@c to assert--and with increasing truth--that there was no great
@c difference between them and the very highest class of Polygons,
@c now that they were raised to an equality with the latter, and enabled
@c to grapple with all the difficulties and solve all the problems of life,
@c whether Statical or Kinetical, by the simple process of Colour Recognition.
@c Not content with the natural neglect into which Sight Recognition was falling,
@c they began boldly to demand the legal prohibition of all "monopolizing
@c and aristocratic Arts" and the consequent abolition of all endowments
@c for the studies of Sight Recognition, Mathematics, and Feeling.
@c Soon, they began to insist that inasmuch as Colour, which was
@c a second Nature, had destroyed the need of aristocratic distinctions,
@c the Law should follow in the same path, and that henceforth all
@c individuals and all classes should be recognized as absolutely equal
@c and entitled to equal rights.
@c 
@c Finding the higher Orders wavering and undecided, the leaders
@c of the Revolution advanced still further in their requirements,
@c and at last demanded that all classes alike, the Priests and the Women
@c not excepted, should do homage to Colour by submitting to be painted. 
@c When it was objected that Priests and Women had no sides, they retorted
@c that Nature and Expediency concurred in dictating that the front half
@c of every human being (that is to say, the half containing his eye and mouth)
@c should be distinguishable from his hinder half.  They therefore brought
@c before a general and extraordinary Assembly of all the States of Flatland
@c a Bill proposing that in every Woman the half containing the eye and mouth
@c should be coloured red, and the other half green.  The Priests were to be
@c painted in the same way, red being applied to that semicircle in which
@c the eye and mouth formed the middle point; while the other or hinder
@c semicircle was to be coloured green.
@c 
@c There was no little cunning in this proposal, which indeed emanated
@c not from any Isosceles--for no being so degraded would have angularity
@c enough to appreciate, much less to devise, such a model of state-craft--
@c but from an Irregular Circle who, instead of being destroyed in his childhood,
@c was reserved by a foolish indulgence to bring desolation on his country
@c and destruction on myriads of followers.
@c 
@c On the one hand the proposition was calculated to bring the Women
@c in all classes over to the side of the Chromatic Innovation.
@c For by assigning to the Women the same two colours as were assigned
@c to the Priests, the Revolutionists thereby ensured that, in certain
@c positions, every Woman would appear as a Priest, and be treated with
@c corresponding respect and deference--a prospect that could not fail
@c to attract the Female Sex in a mass.
@c 
@c But by some of my Readers the possibility of the identical appearance
@c of Priests and Women, under a new Legislation, may not be recognized;
@c if so, a word or two will make it obvious.
@c 
@c Imagine a woman duly decorated, according to the new Code; with the
@c front half (i.e., the half containing the eye and mouth) red,
@c and with the hinder half green.  Look at her from one side.
@c Obviously you will see a straight line, HALF RED, HALF GREEN.
@c 
@c Now imagine a Priest, whose mouth is at M, and whose front
@c semicircle (AMB) is consequently coloured red, while his hinder
@c semicircle is green; so that the diameter AB divides the green
@c from the red.  If you contemplate the Great Man so as to have your eye
@c in the same straight line as his dividing diameter (AB), what you will
@c see will be a straight line (CBD), of which ONE HALF (CB) WILL BE RED,
@c AND THE OTHER (BD) GREEN.  The whole line (CD) will be rather shorter
@c perhaps than that of a full-sized Woman, and will shade off more rapidly
@c towards its extremities; but the identity of the colours would give you
@c an immediate impression of identity in Class, making you neglectful
@c of other details.  Bear in mind the decay of Sight Recognition
@c which threatened society at the time of the Colour revolt;
@c add too the certainty that Woman would speedily learn to
@c shade off their extremities so as to imitate the Circles;
@c it must then be surely obvious to you, my dear Reader,
@c that the Colour Bill placed us under a great danger
@c of confounding a Priest with a young Woman.
@c 
@c How attractive this prospect must have been to the Frail Sex may
@c readily be imagined.  They anticipated with delight the confusion that
@c would ensue.  At home they might hear political and ecclesiastical
@c secrets intended not for them but for their husbands and brothers, and
@c might even issue some commands in the name of a priestly Circle; out
@c of doors the striking combination of red and green without addition
@c of any other colours, would be sure to lead the common people into
@c endless mistakes, and the Woman would gain whatever the Circles lost,
@c in the deference of the passers by.  As for the scandal that would
@c befall the Circular Class if the frivolous and unseemly conduct of the
@c Women were imputed to them, and as to the consequent subversion of the
@c Constitution, the Female Sex could not be expected to give a thought
@c to these considerations.  Even in the households of the Circles, the
@c Women were all in favour of the Universal Colour Bill.
@c 
@c The second object aimed at by the Bill was the gradual
@c demoralization of the Circles themselves.  In the general intellectual
@c decay they still preserved their pristine clearness and strength of
@c understanding.  From their earliest childhood, familiarized in their
@c Circular households with the total absence of Colour, the Nobles alone
@c preserved the Sacred Art of Sight Recognition, with all the advantages
@c that result from that admirable training of the intellect.  Hence, up
@c to the date of the introduction of the Universal Colour Bill, the
@c Circles had not only held their own, but even increased their lead of
@c the other classes by abstinence from the popular fashion.
@c 
@c Now therefore the artful Irregular whom I described above as
@c the real author of this diabolical Bill, determined at one blow
@c to lower the status of the Hierarchy by forcing them to submit
@c to the pollution of Colour, and at the same time to destroy their
@c domestic opportunities of training in the Art of Sight Recognition,
@c so as to enfeeble their intellects by depriving them of their pure
@c and colourless homes.  Once subjected to the chromatic taint,
@c every parental and every childish Circle would demoralize each other.
@c Only in discerning between the Father and the Mother would the Circular
@c infant find problems for the exercise of his understanding--problems
@c too often likely to be corrupted by maternal impostures with the
@c result of shaking the child's faith in all logical conclusions.
@c Thus by degrees the intellectual lustre of the Priestly Order would wane,
@c and the road would then lie open for a total destruction of all Aristocratic
@c Legislature and for the subversion of our Privileged Classes.
@c 
@c 
@c 
@c 
@c SECTION 10  Of the Suppression of the Chromatic Sedition
@c 
@c 
@c The agitation for the Universal Colour Bill continued for three years;
@c and up to the last moment of that period it seemed as though Anarchy
@c were destined to triumph.
@c 
@c A whole army of Polygons, who turned out to fight as private soldiers,
@c was utterly annihilated by a superior force of Isosceles Triangles--
@c the Squares and Pentagons meanwhile remaining neutral.
@c 
@c Worse than all, some of the ablest Circles fell a prey to conjugal fury.
@c Infuriated by political animosity, the wives in many a noble household
@c wearied their lords with prayers to give up their opposition to the
@c Colour Bill; and some, finding their entreaties fruitless, fell on
@c and slaughtered their innocent children and husband, perishing
@c themselves in the act of carnage.  It is recorded that during
@c that triennial agitation no less than twenty-three Circles
@c perished in domestic discord.
@c 
@c Great indeed was the peril.  It seemed as though the Priests
@c had no choice between submission and extermination; when suddenly
@c the course of events was completely changed by one of those picturesque
@c incidents which Statesmen ought never to neglect, often to anticipate,
@c and sometimes perhaps to originate, because of the absurdly
@c disproportionate power with which they appeal to the sympathies
@c of the populace.
@c 
@c It happened that an Isosceles of a low type, with a brain little
@c if at all above four degrees--accidentally dabbling in the colours
@c of some Tradesman whose shop he had plundered--painted himself,
@c or caused himself to be painted (for the story varies) with the twelve
@c colours of a Dodecagon.  Going into the Market Place he accosted
@c in a feigned voice a maiden, the orphan daughter of a noble Polygon,
@c whose affection in former days he had sought in vain; and by a series
@c of deceptions--aided, on the one side, by a string of lucky accidents
@c too long to relate, and, on the other, by an almost inconceivable
@c fatuity and neglect of ordinary precautions on the part of the
@c relations of the bride--he succeeded in consummating the marriage. 
@c The unhappy girl committed suicide on discovering the fraud to which
@c she had been subjected.
@c 
@c When the news of this catastrophe spread from State to State
@c the minds of the Women were violently agitated.  Sympathy with
@c the miserable victim and anticipations of similar deceptions
@c for themselves, their sisters, and their daughters, made them now regard
@c the Colour Bill in an entirely new aspect.  Not a few openly avowed
@c themselves converted to antagonism; the rest needed only a slight
@c stimulus to make a similar avowal.  Seizing this favourable opportunity,
@c the Circles hastily convened an extraordinary Assembly of the States;
@c and besides the usual guard of Convicts, they secured the attendance
@c of a large number of reactionary Women.
@c 
@c Amidst an unprecedented concourse, the Chief Circle of those days
@c --by name Pantocyclus--arose to find himself hissed and hooted by a
@c hundred and twenty thousand Isosceles.  But he secured silence
@c by declaring that henceforth the Circles would enter on a policy
@c of Concession; yielding to the wishes of the majority,
@c they would accept the Colour Bill.  The uproar being
@c at once converted to applause, he invited Chromatistes,
@c the leader of the Sedition, into the centre of the hall,
@c to receive in the name of his followers the submission
@c of the Hierarchy.  Then followed a speech, a masterpiece
@c of rhetoric, which occupied nearly a day in the delivery,
@c and to which no summary can do justice.
@c 
@c With a grave appearance of impartiality he declared that as they
@c were now finally committing themselves to Reform or Innovation,
@c it was desirable that they should take one last view of the perimeter
@c of the whole subject, its defects as well as its advantages.
@c Gradually introduction the mention of the dangers to the Tradesmen,
@c the Professional Classes and the Gentlemen, he silenced the rising murmurs
@c of the Isosceles by reminding them that, in spite of all these defects,
@c he was willing to accept the Bill if it was approved by the majority.
@c But it was manifest that all, except the Isosceles, were moved
@c by his words and were either neutral or averse to the Bill.
@c 
@c Turning now to the Workmen he asserted that their interests must
@c not be neglected, and that, if they intended to accept the Colour Bill,
@c they ought at least to do so with full view of the consequences.
@c Many of them, he said, were on the point of being admitted
@c to the class of the Regular Triangles; others anticipated
@c for their children a distinction they could not hope for themselves.
@c That honourable ambition would not have to be sacrificed.  With the
@c universal adoption of Colour, all distinctions would cease;
@c Regularity would be confused with Irregularity;
@c development would give place to retrogression;
@c the Workman would in a few generations be degraded
@c to the level of the Military, or even the Convict Class;
@c political power would be in the hands of the greatest number,
@c that is to say the Criminal Classes, who were already more
@c numerous than the Workmen, and would soon out-number all
@c the other Classes put together when the usual Compensative Laws
@c of Nature were violated.
@c 
@c A subdued murmur of assent ran through the ranks of the Artisans,
@c and Chromatistes, in alarm, attempted to step forward and address them.
@c But he found himself encompassed with guards and forced to remain silent
@c while the Chief Circle in a few impassioned words made a final appeal
@c to the Women, exclaiming that, if the Colour Bill passed, no marriage
@c would henceforth be safe, no woman's honour secure; fraud, deception,
@c hypocrisy would pervade every household; domestic bliss would share
@c the fate of the Constitution and pass to speedy perdition.
@c "Sooner than this," he cried, "Come death."
@c 
@c At these words, which were the preconcerted signal for action,
@c the Isosceles Convicts fell on and transfixed the wretched Chromatistes;
@c the Regular Classes, opening their ranks, made way for a band of Women who,
@c under direction of the Circles, moved back foremost, invisibly and unerringly
@c upon the unconscious soldiers; the Artisans, imitating the example of their
@c betters, also opened their ranks.  Meantime bands of Convicts occupied
@c every entrance with an impenetrable phalanx.
@c 
@c The battle, or rather carnage, was of short duration.  Under the
@c skillful generalship of the Circles almost every Woman's charge
@c was fatal and very many extracted their sting uninjured, ready for
@c a second slaughter.  But no second blow was needed; the rabble
@c of the Isosceles did the rest of the business for themselves.
@c Surprised, leader-less, attacked in front by invisible foes,
@c and finding egress cut off by the Convicts behind them, they at once--
@c after their manner--lost all presence of mind, and raised the cry
@c of "treachery."  This sealed their fate.  Every Isosceles now saw
@c and felt a foe in every other.  In half an hour not one of that vast
@c multitude was living; and the fragments of seven score thousand
@c of the Criminal Class slain by one another's angles attested
@c the triumph of Order.
@c 
@c The Circles delayed not to push their victory to the uttermost. 
@c The Working Men they spared but decimated.  The Militia of the
@c Equilaterals was at once called out, and every Triangle suspected
@c of Irregularity on reasonable grounds, was destroyed by Court Martial,
@c without the formality of exact measurement by the Social Board.
@c The homes of the Military and Artisan classes were inspected in a course
@c of visitation extending through upwards of a year; and during that period
@c every town, village, and hamlet was systematically purged of that excess
@c of the lower orders which had been brought about by the neglect to pay
@c the tribute of Criminals to the Schools and University, and by the violation
@c of other natural Laws of the Constitution of Flatland.  Thus the balance
@c of classes was again restored.
@c 
@c Needless to say that henceforth the use of Colour was abolished,
@c and its possession prohibited.  Even the utterance of any word
@c denoting Colour, except by the Circles or by qualified scientific
@c teachers, was punished by a severe penalty.  Only at our University
@c in some of the very highest and most esoteric classes--which I myself
@c have never been privileged to attend--it is understood that the
@c sparing use of Colour is still sanctioned for the purpose
@c of illustrating some of the deeper problems of mathematics.
@c But of this I can only speak from hearsay.
@c 
@c Elsewhere in Flatland, Colour is no non-existent.  The art of making
@c it is known to only one living person, the Chief Circle for the time being;
@c and by him it is handed down on his death-bed to none but his Successor.
@c One manufactory alone produces it; and, lest the secret should be betrayed,
@c the Workmen are annually consumed, and fresh ones introduced.  So great
@c is the terror with which even now our Aristocracy looks back to the
@c far-distant days of the agitation for the Universal Colour Bill.

@c 
@c SECTION 11  Concerning our Priests
@c 
@c 
@c It is high time that I should pass from these brief and discursive
@c notes about things in Flatland to the central event of this book,
@c my initiation into the mysteries of Space.  THAT is my subject;
@c all that has gone before is merely preface.
@c 
@c For this reason I must omit many matters of which the explanation
@c would not, I flatter myself, be without interest for my Readers:
@c as for example, our method of propelling and stopping ourselves,
@c although destitute of feet; the means by which we give fixity
@c to structures of wood, stone, or brick, although of course
@c we have no hands, nor can we lay foundations as you can,
@c nor avail ourselves of the lateral pressure of the earth;
@c the manner in which the rain originates in the intervals
@c between our various zones, so that the northern regions
@c do not intercept the moisture falling on the southern;
@c the nature of our hills and mines, our trees and vegetables,
@c our seasons and harvests; our Alphabet and method of writing,
@c adapted to our linear tablets; these and a hundred other details
@c of our physical existence I must pass over, nor do I mention them
@c now except to indicate to my readers that their omission proceeds
@c not from forgetfulness on the part of the author, but from his
@c regard for the time of the Reader. 
@c 
@c Yet before I proceed to my legitimate subject some few final remarks
@c will no doubt be expected by my Readers upon these pillars and mainstays
@c of the Constitution of Flatland, the controllers of our conduct
@c and shapers of our destiny, the objects of universal homage
@c and almost of adoration:  need I say that I mean our Circles or Priests?
@c 
@c When I call them Priests, let me not be understood as meaning
@c no more than the term denotes with you.  With us, our Priests
@c are Administrators of all Business, Art, and Science; Directors of Trade,
@c Commerce, Generalship, Architecture, Engineering, Education,
@c Statesmanship, Legislature, Morality, Theology; doing nothing
@c themselves, they are the Causes of everything worth doing,
@c that is done by others.
@c 
@c Although popularly everyone called a Circle is deemed a Circle,
@c yet among the better educated Classes it is known that no Circle
@c is really a Circle, but only a Polygon with a very large number
@c of very small sides.  As the number of the sides increases, a Polygon
@c approximates to a Circle; and, when the number is very great indeed,
@c say for example three or four hundred, it is extremely difficult
@c for the most delicate touch to feel any polygonal angles.  Let me
@c say rather it WOULD be difficult:  for, as I have shown above,
@c Recognition by Feeling is unknown among the highest society,
@c and to FEEL a Circle would be considered a most audacious insult.
@c This habit of abstention from Feeling in the best society enables
@c a Circle the more easily to sustain the veil of mystery in which,
@c from his earliest years, he is wont to enwrap the exact nature of his
@c Perimeter or Circumference.  Three feet being the average Perimeter
@c it follows that, in a Polygon of three hundred sides each side will
@c be no more than the hundredth part of a foot in length, or little more
@c than the tenth part of an inch; and in a Polygon of six or seven hundred
@c sides the sides are little larger than the diameter of a Spaceland pin-head.
@c It is always assumed, by courtesy, that the Chief Circle for the time being
@c has ten thousand sides.
@c 
@c The ascent of the posterity of the Circles in the social scale is
@c not restricted, as it is among the lower Regular classes, by the Law
@c of Nature which limits the increase of sides to one in each generation.
@c If it were so, the number of sides in the Circle would be a mere question
@c of pedigree and arithmetic, and the four hundred and ninety-seventh
@c descendant of an Equilateral Triangle would necessarily be a polygon
@c with five hundred sides.  But this is not the case.  Nature's Law
@c prescribes two antagonistic decrees affecting Circular propagation;
@c first, that as the race climbs higher in the scale of development,
@c so development shall proceed at an accelerated pace; second,
@c that in the same proportion, the race shall become less fertile.
@c Consequently in the home of a Polygon of four or five hundred sides
@c it is rare to find a son; more than one is never seen.  On the other
@c hand the son of a five-hundred-sided Polygon has been known to possess
@c five hundred and fifty, or even six hundred sides.
@c 
@c Art also steps in to help the process of higher Evolution.
@c Our physicians have discovered that the small and tender sides
@c of an infant Polygon of the higher class can be fractured, and his whole
@c frame re-set, with such exactness that a Polygon of two or three
@c hundred sides sometimes--by no means always, for the process
@c is attended with serious risk--but sometimes overleaps two or three
@c hundred generations, and as it were double at a stroke, the number
@c of his progenitors and the nobility of his descent.
@c 
@c Many a promising child is sacrificed in this way.  Scarcely one
@c out of ten survives.  Yet so strong is the parental ambition among
@c those Polygons who are, as it were, on the fringe of the Circular
@c class, that it is very rare to find the Nobleman of that position
@c in society, who has neglected to place his first-born in the Circular
@c Neo-Therapeutic Gymnasium before he has attained the age of a month.
@c 
@c One year determines success or failure.  At the end of that time
@c the child has, in all probability, added one more to the tombstones
@c that crowd the Neo-Therapeutic Cemetery; but on rare occasional a glad
@c procession bares back the little one to his exultant parents, no longer
@c a Polygon, but a Circle, at least by courtesy:  and a single instance
@c of so blessed a result induces multitudes of Polygonal parents to submit
@c to similar domestic sacrifice, which have a dissimilar issue.
@c 
@c 
@c 
@c 
@c SECTION 12  Of the Doctrine of our Priests
@c 
@c 
@c As to the doctrine of the Circles it may briefly be summed up
@c in a single maxim, "Attend to your Configuration."  Whether political,
@c ecclesiastical, or moral, all their teaching has for its object
@c the improvement of individual and collective Configuration--with special
@c reference of course to the Configuration of the Circles, to which all
@c other objects are subordinated.
@c 
@c It is the merit of the Circles that they have effectually
@c suppressed those ancient heresies which led men to waste energy
@c and sympathy in the vain belief that conduct depends upon will, effort,
@c training, encouragement, praise, or anything else but Configuration. 
@c It was Pantocyclus--the illustrious Circle mentioned above, as the
@c queller of the Colour Revolt--who first convinced mankind that
@c Configuration makes the man; that if, for example, you are born
@c an Isosceles with two uneven sides, you will assuredly go wrong
@c unless you have them made even--for which purpose you must go
@c to the Isosceles Hospital; similarly, if you are a Triangle,
@c or Square, or even a Polygon, born with any Irregularity,
@c you must be taken to one of the Regular Hospitals to
@c have your disease cured; otherwise you will end your days
@c in the State Prison or by the angle of the State Executioner.
@c 
@c All faults or defects, from the slightest misconduct to the
@c most flagitious crime, Pantocyclus attributed to some deviation
@c from perfect Regularity in the bodily figure, caused perhaps
@c (if not congenital) by some collision in a crowd; by neglect
@c to take exercise, or by taking too much of it; or even by
@c a sudden change of temperature, resulting in a shrinkage
@c or expansion in some too susceptible part of the frame.
@c Therefore, concluded that illustrious Philosopher,
@c neither good conduct nor bad conduct is a fit subject,
@c in any sober estimation, for either praise or blame.
@c For why should you praise, for example, the integrity
@c of a Square who faithfully defends the interests of his client,
@c when you ought in reality rather to admire the exact precision
@c of his right angles?  Or again, why blame a lying,
@c thievish Isosceles, when you ought rather to deplore
@c the incurable inequality of his sides?
@c 
@c Theoretically, this doctrine is unquestionable; but it
@c has practical drawbacks.  In dealing with an Isosceles,
@c if a rascal pleads that he cannot help stealing because
@c of his unevenness, you reply that for that very reason,
@c because he cannot help being a nuisance to his neighbours,
@c you, the Magistrate, cannot help sentencing him to be consumed--
@c and there's an end of the matter.  But in little domestic difficulties,
@c when the penalty of consumption, or death, is out of the question,
@c this theory of Configuration sometimes comes in awkwardly;
@c and I must confess that occasionally when one of my own Hexagonal
@c Grandsons pleads as an excuse for his disobedience that a sudden
@c change of temperature has been too much for his Perimeter,
@c and that I ought to lay the blame not on him but on his Configuration,
@c which can only be strengthened by abundance of the choicest sweetmeats,
@c I neither see my way logically to reject, nor practically to accept,
@c his conclusions.
@c 
@c For my own part, I find it best to assume that a good sound scolding
@c or castigation has some latent and strengthening influence on
@c my Grandson's Configuration; though I own that I have no grounds
@c for thinking so.  At all events I am not alone in my way of extricating
@c myself from this dilemma; for I find that many of the highest Circles,
@c sitting as Judges in law courts, use praise and blame towards Regular
@c and Irregular Figures; and in their homes I know by experience that,
@c when scolding their children, they speak about "right" and "wrong"
@c as vehemently and passionately as if they believe that these names
@c represented real existence, and that a human Figure is really capable
@c of choosing between them.
@c 
@c Constantly carrying out their policy of making Configuration
@c the leading idea in every mind, the Circles reverse the nature
@c of that Commandment which in Spaceland regulates the relations between
@c parents and children.  With you, children are taught to honour their parents;
@c with us--next to the Circles, who are the chief object of universal homage--
@c a man is taught to honour his Grandson, if he has one; or, if not, his Son.
@c By "honour," however, is by no means mean "indulgence," but a reverent
@c regard for their highest interests:  and the Circles teach that the duty
@c of fathers is to subordinate their own interests to those of posterity,
@c thereby advancing the welfare of the whole State as well as that
@c of their own immediate descendants.
@c 
@c The weak point in the system of the Circles--if a humble Square
@c may venture to speak of anything Circular as containing any element
@c of weakness--appears to me to be found in their relations with Women.
@c 
@c As it is of the utmost importance for Society that Irregular
@c births should be discouraged, it follows that no Woman who has any
@c Irregularities in her ancestry is a fit partner for one who desires
@c that his posterity should rise by regular degrees in the social scale.
@c 
@c Now the Irregularity of a Male is a matter of measurement; but as
@c all Women are straight, and therefore visibly Regular so to speak, one
@c has to device some other means of ascertaining what I may call their
@c invisible Irregularity, that is to say their potential Irregularities
@c as regards possible offspring.  This is effected by carefully-kept
@c pedigrees, which are preserved and supervised by the State; and without
@c a certified pedigree no Woman is allowed to marry.
@c 
@c Now it might have been supposed the a Circle--proud of his ancestry
@c and regardful for a posterity which might possibly issue hereafter
@c in a Chief Circle--would be more careful than any other to choose
@c a wife who had no blot on her escutcheon.  But it is not so.
@c The care in choosing a Regular wife appears to diminish as one rises
@c in the social scale.  Nothing would induce an aspiring Isosceles,
@c who has hopes of generating an Equilateral Son, to take a wife
@c who reckoned a single Irregularity among her Ancestors; a Square
@c or Pentagon, who is confident that his family is steadily on the rise,
@c does not inquire above the five-hundredth generation; a Hexagon
@c or Dodecagon is even more careless of the wife's pedigree;
@c but a Circle has been known deliberately to take a wife
@c who has had an Irregular Great-Grandfather, and all because
@c of some slight superiority of lustre, or because of the charms
@c of a low voice--which, with us, even more than with you,
@c is thought "an excellent thing in a Woman." 
@c 
@c Such ill-judged marriages are, as might be expected, barren, if they
@c do not result in positive Irregularity or in diminution of sides;
@c but none of these evils have hitherto provided sufficiently deterrent. 
@c The loss of a few sides in a highly-developed Polygon is not easily
@c noticed, and is sometimes compensated by a successful operation in
@c the Neo-Therapeutic Gymnasium, as I have described above; and the Circles
@c are too much disposed to acquiesce in infecundity as a law of the
@c superior development.  Yet, if this evil be not arrested, the gradual
@c diminution of the Circular class may soon become more rapid, and the
@c time may not be far distant when, the race being no longer able to
@c produce a Chief Circle, the Constitution of Flatland must fall.
@c 
@c One other word of warning suggest itself to me, though I cannot
@c so easily mention a remedy; and this also refers to our relations
@c with Women.  About three hundred years ago, it was decreed by the
@c Chief Circle that, since women are deficient in Reason but abundant
@c in Emotion, they ought no longer to be treated as rational, nor receive
@c any mental education.  The consequence was that they were no longer
@c taught to read, nor even to master Arithmetic enough to enable them
@c to count the angles of their husband or children; and hence they sensibly
@c declined during each generation in intellectual power.  And this
@c system of female non-education or quietism still prevails.
@c 
@c My fear is that, with the best intentions, this policy has been
@c carried so far as to react injuriously on the Male Sex.
@c 
@c For the consequence is that, as things now are, we Males have to
@c lead a kind of bi-lingual, and I may almost say bimental, existence. 
@c With Women, we speak of "love," "duty," "right," "wrong," "pity,"
@c "hope," and other irrational and emotional conceptions, which have
@c no existence, and the fiction of which has no object except to control
@c feminine exuberances; but among ourselves, and in our books, we have
@c an entirely different vocabulary and I may also say, idiom.  "Love"
@c them becomes "the anticipation of benefits"; "duty" becomes "necessity"
@c or "fitness"; and other words are correspondingly transmuted.
@c Moreover, among Women, we use language implying the utmost deference
@c for their Sex; and they fully believe that the Chief Circle Himself
@c is not more devoutly adored by us than they are:  but behind their
@c backs they are both regarded and spoken of--by all but the very young--
@c as being little better than "mindless organisms."
@c 
@c Our Theology also in the Women's chambers is entirely different
@c from our Theology elsewhere.
@c 
@c Now my humble fear is that this double training, in language
@c as well as in thought, imposes somewhat too heavy a burden upon
@c the young, especially when, at the age of three years old, they are
@c taken from the maternal care and taught to unlearn the old language--
@c except for the purpose of repeating it in the presence of the Mothers
@c and Nurses--and to learn the vocabulary and idiom of science. 
@c Already methinks I discern a weakness in the grasp of mathematical
@c truth at the present time as compared with the more robust intellect
@c of our ancestors three hundred years ago.  I say nothing of the possible
@c danger if a Woman should ever surreptitiously learn to read and convey
@c to her Sex the result of her perusal of a single popular volume;
@c nor of the possibility that the indiscretion or disobedience of some
@c infant Male might reveal to a Mother the secrets of the logical dialect.
@c On the simple ground of the enfeebling of the male intellect,
@c I rest this humble appeal to the highest Authorities to reconsider
@c the regulations of Female education.

@c SECTION 13  How I had a Vision of Lineland
@c 
@c 
@c It was the last day but one of the 1999th year of our era, and the
@c first day of the Long Vacation.  Having amused myself till a late hour
@c with my favourite recreation of Geometry, I had retired to rest
@c with an unsolved problem in my mind.  In the night I had a dream.
@c 
@c I saw before me a vast multitude of small Straight Lines
@c (which I naturally assumed to be Women) interspersed with other Beings
@c still smaller and of the nature of lustrous points--all moving to and fro
@c in one and the same Straight Line, and, as nearly as I could judge,
@c with the same velocity.
@c 
@c A noise of confused, multitudinous chirping or twittering issued
@c from them at intervals as long as they were moving; but sometimes
@c they ceased from motion, and then all was silence.
@c 
@c Approaching one of the largest of what I thought to be Women,
@c I accosted her, but received no answer.  A second and third appeal
@c on my part were equally ineffectual.  Losing patience at what appeared
@c to me intolerable rudeness, I brought my mouth to a position full
@c in front of her mouth so as to intercept her motion, and loudly repeated
@c my question, "Woman, what signifies this concourse, and this strange
@c and confused chirping, and this monotonous motion to and fro in one
@c and the same Straight Line?"
@c 
@c "I am no Woman," replied the small Line:  "I am the Monarch of the world.
@c But thou, whence intrudest thou into my realm of Lineland?" 
@c Receiving this abrupt reply, I begged pardon if I had in any way
@c startled or molested his Royal Highness; and describing myself
@c as a stranger I besought the King to give me some account of his dominions. 
@c But I had the greatest possible difficulty in obtaining any information
@c on points that really interested me; for the Monarch could not refrain
@c from constantly assuming that whatever was familiar to him must also
@c be known to me and that I was simulating ignorance in jest.
@c However, by preserving questions I elicited the following facts:
@c 
@c It seemed that this poor ignorant Monarch--as he called himself--
@c was persuaded that the Straight Line which he called his Kingdom,
@c and in which he passed his existence, constituted the whole of the world,
@c and indeed the whole of Space.  Not being able either to move or to see,
@c save in his Straight Line, he had no conception of anything out of it. 
@c Though he had heard my voice when I first addressed him, the sounds
@c had come to him in a manner so contrary to his experience that he had
@c made no answer, "seeing no man," as he expressed it, "and hearing
@c a voice as it were from my own intestines."  Until the moment when
@c I placed my mouth in his World, he had neither seen me, nor heard
@c anything except confused sounds beating against, what I called his side,
@c but what he called his INSIDE or STOMACH; nor had he even now the least
@c conception of the region from which I had come.  Outside his World,
@c or Line, all was a blank to him; nay, not even a blank, for a blank
@c implies Space; say, rather, all was non-existent.
@c 
@c His subjects--of whom the small Lines were men and the Points Women--
@c were all alike confined in motion and eyesight to that single Straight Line,
@c which was their World.  It need scarcely be added that the whole of their
@c horizon was limited to a Point; nor could any one ever see anything
@c but a Point.  Man, woman, child, thing--each as a Point to the eye
@c of a Linelander.  Only by the sound of the voice could sex or age
@c be distinguished.  Moreover, as each individual occupied the whole
@c of the narrow path, so to speak, which constituted his Universe,
@c and no one could move to the right or left to make way for passers by,
@c it followed that no Linelander could ever pass another.  Once neighbours,
@c always neighbours.  Neighbourhood with them was like marriage with us.
@c Neighbours remained neighbours till death did them part.
@c 
@c Such a life, with all vision limited to a Point, and all motion
@c to a Straight Line, seemed to me inexpressibly dreary; and I was
@c surprised to note that vivacity and cheerfulness of the King. 
@c Wondering whether it was possible, amid circumstances so unfavourable
@c to domestic relations, to enjoy the pleasures of conjugal union,
@c I hesitated for some time to question his Royal Highness on so delicate
@c a subject; but at last I plunged into it by abruptly inquiring
@c as to the health of his family.  "My wives and children," he replied,
@c "are well and happy."
@c 
@c Staggered at this answer--for in the immediate proximity of the Monarch
@c (as I had noted in my dream before I entered Lineland) there were none
@c but Men--I ventured to reply, "Pardon me, but I cannot imagine how your
@c Royal Highness can at any time either se or approach their Majesties,
@c when there at least half a dozen intervening individuals, whom you can
@c neither see through, nor pass by?  Is it possible that in Lineland
@c proximity is not necessary for marriage and for the generation of children?"
@c 
@c "How can you ask so absurd a question?" replied the Monarch.  "If it were
@c indeed as you suggest, the Universe would soon be depopulated.  No, no;
@c neighbourhood is needless for the union of hearts; and the birth
@c of children is too important a matter to have been allowed to depend
@c upon such an accident as proximity.  You cannot be ignorant of this.
@c Yet since you are pleased to affect ignorance, I will instruct you
@c as if you were the veriest baby in Lineland.  Know, then, that marriages
@c are consummated by means of the faculty of sound and the sense of hearing.
@c 
@c "You are of course aware that every Man has two mouths or voices--
@c as well as two eyes--a bass at one and a tenor at the other of his
@c extremities.  I should not mention this, but that I have been
@c unable to distinguish your tenor in the course of our conversation."
@c I replied that I had but one voice, and that I had not been aware
@c that his Royal Highness had two.  "That confirms by impression,"
@c said the King, "that you are not a Man, but a feminine Monstrosity
@c with a bass voice, and an utterly uneducated ear.  But to continue.
@c 
@c "Nature having herself ordained that every Man should wed two wives--"
@c "Why two?" asked I.  "You carry your affected simplicity too far,"
@c he cried.  "How can there be a completely harmonious union without
@c the combination of the Four in One, viz. the Bass and Tenor of the Man
@c and the Soprano and Contralto of the two Women?"  "But supposing,"
@c said I, "that a man should prefer one wife or three?"  "It is impossible,"
@c he said; "it is as inconceivable as that two and one should make five,
@c or that the human eye should see a Straight Line."  I would have
@c interrupted him; but he proceeded as follows:
@c 
@c "Once in the middle of each week a Law of Nature compels us to move
@c to and fro with a rhythmic motion of more than usual violence,
@c which continues for the time you would take to count a hundred and one.
@c In the midst of this choral dance, at the fifty-first pulsation,
@c the inhabitants of the Universe pause in full career, and each
@c individual sends forth his richest, fullest, sweetest strain.
@c It is in this decisive moment that all our marriages are made.
@c So exquisite is the adaptation of Bass and Treble, of Tenor to Contralto,
@c that oftentimes the Loved Ones, though twenty thousand leagues away,
@c recognize at once the responsive note of their destined Lover; and,
@c penetrating the paltry obstacles of distance, Love unites the three.
@c The marriage in that instance consummated results in a threefold Male
@c and Female offspring which takes its place in Lineland."
@c 
@c "What!  Always threefold?" said I.  "Must one wife then always have twins?"
@c 
@c "Bass-voice Monstrosity! yes," replied the King.  "How else could
@c the balance of the Sexes be maintained, if two girls were not born
@c for every boy?  Would you ignore the very Alphabet of Nature?"
@c He ceased, speechless for fury; and some time elapsed before
@c I could induce him to resume his narrative.
@c 
@c "You will not, of course, suppose that every bachelor among us finds
@c his mates at the first wooing in this universal Marriage Chorus.
@c On the contrary, the process is by most of us many times repeated. 
@c Few are the hearts whose happy lot is at once to recognize in each
@c other's voice the partner intended for them by Providence, and to fly
@c into a reciprocal and perfectly harmonious embrace.  With most of us
@c the courtship is of long duration.  The Wooer's voices may perhaps
@c accord with one of the future wives, but not with both; or not,
@c at first, with either; or the Soprano and Contralto may not quite
@c harmonize.  In such cases Nature has provided that every weekly Chorus
@c shall bring the three Lovers into closer harmony.  Each trial of voice,
@c each fresh discovery of discord, almost imperceptibly induces the less
@c perfect to modify his or her vocal utterance so as to approximate
@c to the more perfect.  And after many trials and many approximations,
@c the result is at last achieved.  There comes a day at last when,
@c while the wonted Marriage Chorus goes forth from universal Lineland,
@c the three far-off Lovers suddenly find themselves in exact harmony,
@c and, before they are aware, the wedded Triplet is rapt vocally into
@c a duplicate embrace; and Nature rejoices over one more marriage
@c and over three more births."

@c 
@c SECTION 14  How I vainly tried to explain the nature of Flatland
@c 
@c 
@c Thinking that it was time to bring down the Monarch from his raptures
@c to the level of common sense, I determined to endeavour to open up
@c to him some glimpses of the truth, that is to say of the nature
@c of things in Flatland.  So I began thus:  "How does your Royal Highness
@c distinguish the shapes and positions of his subjects?  I for my part
@c noticed by the sense of sight, before I entered your Kingdom,
@c that some of your people are lines and others Points;
@c and that some of the lines are larger --"  "You speak of an impossibility,"
@c interrupted the King; "you must have seen a vision; for to detect the difference
@c between a Line and a Point by the sense of sight is, as every one knows,
@c in the nature of things, impossible; but it can be detected by the sense
@c of hearing, and by the same means my shape can be exactly ascertained.
@c Behold me--I am a Line, the longest in Lineland, over six inches of Space --"
@c "Of Length," I ventured to suggest.  "Fool," said he, "Space is Length.
@c Interrupt me again, and I have done."
@c 
@c I apologized; but he continued scornfully, "Since you are impervious
@c to argument, you shall hear with your ears how by means of my two voices
@c I reveal my shape to my Wives, who are at this moment six thousand miles
@c seventy yards two feet eight inches away, the one to the North,
@c the other to the South.  Listen, I call to them."
@c 
@c He chirruped, and then complacently continued:  "My wives at this
@c moment receiving the sound of one of my voice, closely followed
@c by the other, and perceiving that the latter reaches them after an interval
@c in which sound can traverse 6.457 inches, infer that one of my mouths
@c is 6.457 inches further from them than the other, and accordingly know
@c my shape to be 6.457 inches.  But you will of course understand that
@c my wives do not make this calculation every time they hear my two voices.
@c They made it, once for all, before we were married.  But they COULD
@c make it at any time.  And in the same way I can estimate the shape
@c of any of my Male subjects by the sense of sound."
@c 
@c "But how," said I, "if a Man feigns a Woman's voice with one of his
@c two voices, or so disguises his Southern voice that it cannot
@c be recognized as the echo of the Northern?  May not such deceptions
@c cause great inconvenience?  And have you no means of checking frauds
@c of this kind by commanding your neighbouring subjects to feel one another?"
@c This of course was a very stupid question, for feeling could not have
@c answered the purpose; but I asked with the view of irritating the Monarch,
@c and I succeeded perfectly.
@c 
@c "What!" cried he in horror, "explain your meaning."  "Feel, touch,
@c come into contact," I replied..  "If you mean by FEELING," said the
@c King, "approaching so close as to leave no space between two individuals,
@c know, Stranger, that this offence is punishable in my dominions by death.
@c And the reason is obvious.  The frail form of a Woman, being liable
@c to be shattered by such an approximation, must be preserved by the State;
@c but since Women cannot be distinguished by the sense of sight from Men,
@c the Law ordains universally that neither Man nor Woman shall be
@c approached so closely as to destroy the interval between the approximator
@c and the approximated.
@c 
@c "And indeed what possible purpose would be served by this illegal
@c and unnatural excess of approximation which you call TOUCHING,
@c when all the ends of so brutal and course a process are attained
@c at once more easily and more exactly by the sense of hearing?
@c As to your suggested danger of deception, it is non-existent:
@c for the Voice, being the essence of one's Being, cannot be
@c thus changed at will.  But come, suppose that I had the power
@c of passing through solid things, so that I could penetrate my subjects,
@c one after another, even to the number of a billion, verifying the size
@c and distance of each by the sense of FEELING:  How much time and energy
@c would be wasted in this clumsy and inaccurate method!  Whereas now,
@c in one moment of audition, I take as it were the census and statistics,
@c local, corporeal, mental and spiritual, of every living being in Lineland.
@c Hark, only hark!"
@c 
@c So saying he paused and listened, as if in an ecstasy, to a sound
@c which seemed to me no better than a tiny chirping from an innumerable
@c multitude of lilliputian grasshoppers.
@c 
@c "Truly," replied I, "your sense of hearing serves you in good stead,
@c and fills up many of your deficiencies.  But permit me to point out
@c that your life in Lineland must be deplorably dull.  To see nothing
@c but a Point!  Not even to be able to contemplate a Straight Line!
@c Nay, not even to know what a Straight Line is!  To see, yet to be cut
@c off from those Linear prospects which are vouchsafed to us in Flatland!
@c Better surely to have no sense of sight at all than to see so little!
@c I grant you I have not your discriminative faculty of hearing;
@c for the concert of all Lineland which gives you such intense pleasure,
@c is to me no better than a multitudinous twittering or chirping.
@c But at least I can discern, by sight, a Line from a Point.
@c And let me prove it.  Just before I came into your kingdom,
@c I saw you dancing from left to right, and then from right to left,
@c with Seven Men and a Woman in your immediate proximity on the left,
@c and eight Men and two Women on your right.  Is not this correct?"
@c 
@c "It is correct," said the King, "so far as the numbers and sexes
@c are concerned, though I know not what you mean by `right' and `left.' 
@c But I deny that you saw these things.  For how could you see the Line,
@c that is to say the inside, of any Man?  But you must have heard these
@c things, and then dreamed that you saw them.  And let me ask what you
@c mean by those words `left' and `right.'  I suppose it is your way
@c of saying Northward and Southward."
@c 
@c "Not so," replied I; "besides your motion of Northward and Southward,
@c there is another motion which I call from right to left."
@c 
@c King.  Exhibit to me, if you please, this motion from left to right.
@c 
@c I.  Nay, that I cannot do, unless you could step out of your Line altogether.
@c 
@c King.  Out of my Line?  Do you mean out of the world?  Out of Space?
@c 
@c I.  Well, yes.  Out of YOUR world.  Out of YOUR Space.  For your
@c Space is not the true Space.  True Space is a Plane; but your
@c Space is only a Line.
@c 
@c King.  If you cannot indicate this motion from left to right by yourself
@c moving in it, then I beg you to describe it to me in words.
@c 
@c I.  If you cannot tell your right side from your left, I fear
@c that no words of mine can make my meaning clearer to you.
@c But surely you cannot be ignorant of so simple a distinction.
@c 
@c King.  I do not in the least understand you.
@c 
@c I.  Alas!  How shall I make it clear?  When you move straight on,
@c does it not sometimes occur to you that you COULD move in some other way,
@c turning your eye round so as to look in the direction towards which your
@c side is now fronting?  In other words, instead of always moving
@c in the direction of one of your extremities, do you never feel
@c a desire to move in the direction, so to speak, of your side?
@c 
@c King.  Never.  And what do you mean?  How can a man's inside "front"
@c in any direction?  Or how can a man move in the direction of his inside?
@c 
@c I.  Well then, since words cannot explain the matter, I will try deeds,
@c and will move gradually out of Lineland in the direction which I desire
@c to indicate to you.
@c 
@c At the word I began to move my body out of Lineland.  As long
@c as any part of me remained in his dominion and in his view, the King
@c kept exclaiming, "I see you, I see you still; you are not moving."
@c But when I had at last moved myself out of his Line, he cried in his
@c shrillest voice, "She is vanished; she is dead."  "I am not dead,"
@c replied I; "I am simply out of Lineland, that is to say, out of the
@c Straight Line which you call Space, and in the true Space, where I can
@c see things as they are.  And at this moment I can see your Line,
@c or side--or inside as you are pleased to call it; and I can see also
@c the Men and Women on the North and South of you, whom I will now enumerate,
@c describing their order, their size, and the interval between each."
@c 
@c When I had done this at great length, I cried triumphantly,
@c "Does that at last convince you?"  And, with that, I once more
@c entered Lineland, taking up the same position as before.
@c 
@c But the Monarch replied, "If you were a Man of sense--though, as
@c you appear to have only one voice I have little doubt you are not a
@c Man but a Woman--but, if you had a particle of sense, you would
@c listen to reason.  You ask me to believe that there is another Line
@c besides that which my senses indicate, and another motion besides that
@c of which I am daily conscious.  I, in return, ask you to describe
@c in words or indicate by motion that other Line of which you speak. 
@c Instead of moving, you merely exercise some magic art of vanishing
@c and returning to sight; and instead of any lucid description of your
@c new World, you simply tell me the numbers and sizes of some forty
@c of my retinue, facts known to any child in my capital.  Can anything
@c be more irrational or audacious?  Acknowledge your folly or depart
@c from my dominions."
@c 
@c Furious at his perversity, and especially indignant that he professed
@c to be ignorant of my sex, I retorted in no measured terms, "Besotted Being!
@c You think yourself the perfection of existence, while you are in reality
@c the most imperfect and imbecile.  You profess to see, whereas you see
@c nothing but a Point!  You plume yourself on inferring the existence
@c of a Straight Line; but I CAN SEE Straight Lines, and infer the existence
@c of Angles, Triangles, Squares, Pentagons, Hexagons, and even Circles.
@c Why waste more words?  Suffice it that I am the completion of your
@c incomplete self.  You are a Line, but I am a Line of Lines called
@c in my country a Square:  and even I, infinitely superior though
@c I am to you, am of little account among the great nobles of Flatland,
@c whence I have come to visit you, in the hope of enlightening your ignorance."
@c 
@c Hearing these words the King advanced towards me with a menacing cry
@c as if to pierce me through the diagonal; and in that same movement
@c there arose from myriads of his subjects a multitudinous war-cry,
@c increasing in vehemence till at last methought it rivalled the roar
@c of an army of a hundred thousand Isosceles, and the artillery
@c of a thousand Pentagons.  Spell-bound and motionless, I could
@c neither speak nor move to avert the impending destruction;
@c and still the noise grew louder, and the King came closer,
@c when I awoke to find the breakfast-bell recalling me
@c to the realities of Flatland.  
@c 
@c 
@c 
@c 
@c SECTION 15  Concerning a Stranger from Spaceland
@c 
@c 
@c From dreams I proceed to facts.
@c 
@c It was the last day of our 1999th year of our era.
@c The patterning of the rain had long ago announced nightfall;
@c and I was sitting (footnote 3) in the company of my wife,
@c musing on the events of the past and the prospects of the coming year,
@c the coming century, the coming Millennium.
@c 
@c My four Sons and two orphan Grandchildren had retired to their
@c several apartments; and my wife alone remained with me to see
@c the old Millennium out and the new one in.
@c 
@c I was rapt in thought, pondering in my mind some words that had
@c casually issued from the mouth of my youngest Grandson, a most
@c promising young Hexagon of unusual brilliancy and perfect angularity. 
@c His uncles and I had been giving him his usual practical lesson in
@c Sight Recognition, turning ourselves upon our centres, now rapidly,
@c now more slowly, and questioning him as to our positions; and his
@c answers had been so satisfactory that I had been induced to reward him
@c by giving him a few hints on Arithmetic, as applied to Geometry.
@c 
@c Taking nine Squares, each an inch every way, I had put them together
@c so as to make one large Square, with a side of three inches,
@c and I had hence proved to my little Grandson that--though it
@c was impossible for us to SEE the inside of the Square--
@c yet we might ascertain the number of square inches in a Square
@c by simply squaring the number of inches in the side:  "and thus,"
@c said I, "we know that three-to-the-second, or nine, represents the
@c number of square inches in a Square whose side is three inches long."
@c 
@c The little Hexagon meditated on this a while and then said to me;
@c "But you have been teaching me to raise numbers to the third power:
@c I suppose three-to-the-third must mean something in Geometry; what does
@c it mean?"  "Nothing at all," replied I, "not at least in Geometry;
@c for Geometry has only Two Dimensions."  And then I began to shew the boy
@c how a Point by moving through a length of three inches makes a Line of
@c three inches, which may be represented by three; and how a Line of three
@c inches, moving parallel to itself through a length of three inches,
@c makes a Square of three inches every way, which may be represented
@c by three-to-the-second.
@c xxx
@c Upon this, my Grandson, again returning to his former suggestion,
@c took me up rather suddenly and exclaimed, "Well, then, if a Point by
@c moving three inches, makes a Line of three inches represented by three;
@c and if a straight Line of three inches, moving parallel to itself,
@c makes a Square of three inches every way, represented by three-to-the-second;
@c it must be that a Square of three inches every way, moving somehow parallel
@c to itself (but I don't see how) must make Something else (but I don't see what)
@c of three inches every way--and this must be represented by three-to-the-third."
@c 
@c "Go to bed," said I, a little ruffled by this interruption: 
@c "if you would talk less nonsense, you would remember more sense."
@c 
@c So my Grandson had disappeared in disgrace; and there I sat by my
@c Wife's side, endeavouring to form a retrospect of the year 1999 and of
@c the possibilities of the year 2000; but not quite able to shake of the
@c thoughts suggested by the prattle of my bright little Hexagon.  Only a
@c few sands now remained in the half-hour glass.  Rousing myself from my
@c reverie I turned the glass Northward for the last time in the old
@c Millennium; and in the act, I exclaimed aloud, "The boy is a fool."
@c 
@c Straightway I became conscious of a Presence in the room, and a
@c chilling breath thrilled through my very being.  "He is no such thing,"
@c cried my Wife, "and you are breaking the Commandments in thus
@c dishonouring your own Grandson."  But I took no notice of her.
@c Looking around in every direction I could see nothing; yet still
@c I FELT a Presence, and shivered as the cold whisper came again.
@c I started up.  "What is the matter?" said my Wife, "there is no draught;
@c what are you looking for?  There is nothing."  There was nothing;
@c and I resumed my seat, again exclaiming, "The boy is a fool, I say;
@c three- to-the-third can have no meaning in Geometry."
@c At once there came a distinctly audible reply,
@c "The boy is not a fool; and three-to-the-third
@c has an obvious Geometrical meaning." 
@c 
@c My Wife as well as myself heard the words, although she did not
@c understand their meaning, and both of us sprang forward in the direction
@c of the sound.  What was our horror when we saw before us a Figure!
@c At the first glance it appeared to be a Woman, seen sideways;
@c but a moment's observation shewed me that the extremities passed
@c into dimness too rapidly to represent one of the Female Sex;
@c and I should have thought it a Circle, only that it seemed
@c to change its size in a manner impossible for a Circle
@c or for any regular Figure of which I had had experience.
@c 
@c But my Wife had not my experience, nor the coolness necessary
@c to note these characteristics.  With the usual hastiness
@c and unreasoning jealousy of her Sex, she flew at once
@c to the conclusion that a Woman had entered the house
@c through some small aperture.  "How comes this person here?"
@c she exclaimed, "you promised me, my dear, that there should
@c be no ventilators in our new house."  "Nor are they any," said I;
@c "but what makes you think that the stranger is a Woman?
@c I see by my power of Sight Recognition --"
@c 
@c "Oh, I have no patience with your Sight Recognition," replied she,
@c "`Feeling is believing' and `A Straight Line to the touch is worth
@c a Circle to the sight'"--two Proverbs, very common with the Frailer
@c Sex in Flatland.
@c 
@c "Well," said I, for I was afraid of irritating her, "if it must be so,
@c demand an introduction."  Assuming her most gracious manner, my Wife
@c advanced towards the Stranger, "Permit me, Madam to feel and be felt by--"
@c then, suddenly recoiling, "Oh! it is not a Woman, and there are no angles
@c either, not a trace of one.  Can it be that I have so misbehaved
@c to a perfect Circle?"
@c 
@c "I am indeed, in a certain sense a Circle," replied the Voice,
@c "and a more perfect Circle than any in Flatland; but to speak more
@c accurately, I am many Circles in one."  Then he added more mildly,
@c "I have a message, dear Madam, to your husband, which I must not
@c deliver in your presence; and, if you would suffer us to retire
@c for a few minutes --"  But my wife would not listen to the proposal
@c that our august Visitor should so incommode himself, and assuring
@c the Circle that the hour of her own retirement had long passed,
@c with many reiterated apologies for her recent indiscretion,
@c she at last retreated to her apartment.
@c 
@c I glanced at the half-hour glass.  The last sands had fallen.
@c The third Millennium had begun.
@c 
@c 
@c Footnote 3.  When I say "sitting," of course I do not mean any change
@c of attitude such as you in Spaceland signify by that word; for as we
@c have no feet, we can no more "sit" nor "stand" (in your sense of the
@c word) than one of your soles or flounders.
@c 
@c Nevertheless, we perfectly well recognize the different mental
@c states of volition implied by "lying," "sitting," and "standing,"
@c which are to some extent indicated to a beholder by a slight increase
@c of lustre corresponding to the increase of volition.
@c 
@c But on this, and a thousand other kindred subjects, time forbids me to dwell.
@c 
@c 
@c 
@c 
@c SECTION 16  How the Stranger vainly endeavoured to reveal to me
@c              in words the mysteries of Spaceland
@c 
@c 
@c As soon as the sound of the Peace-cry of my departing Wife had died away,
@c I began to approach the Stranger with the intention of taking a nearer
@c view and of bidding him be seated:  but his appearance struck me dumb
@c and motionless with astonishment.  Without the slightest symptoms
@c of angularity he nevertheless varied every instant with graduations
@c of size and brightness scarcely possible for any Figure within the scope
@c of my experience.  The thought flashed across me that I might have before
@c me a burglar or cut-throat, some monstrous Irregular Isosceles, who,
@c by feigning the voice of a Circle, had obtained admission somehow
@c into the house, and was now preparing to stab me with his acute angle.
@c 
@c In a sitting-room, the absence of Fog (and the season happened
@c to be remarkably dry), made it difficult for me to trust to Sight
@c Recognition, especially at the short distance at which I was standing. 
@c Desperate with fear, I rushed forward with an unceremonious, "You must
@c permit me, Sir --" and felt him.  My Wife was right.  There was not
@c the trace of an angle, not the slightest roughness or inequality: 
@c never in my life had I met with a more perfect Circle.  He remained
@c motionless while I walked around him, beginning from his eye
@c and returning to it again.  Circular he was throughout,
@c a perfectly satisfactory Circle; there could not be a doubt of it.
@c Then followed a dialogue, which I will endeavour to set down as near
@c as I can recollect it, omitting only some of my profuse apologies--
@c for I was covered with shame and humiliation that I, a Square,
@c should have been guilty of the impertinence of feeling a Circle.
@c It was commenced by the Stranger with some impatience at the
@c lengthiness of my introductory process.
@c 
@c Stranger.  Have you felt me enough by this time?  Are you not
@c introduced to me yet?
@c 
@c I.  Most illustrious Sir, excuse my awkwardness, which arises not
@c from ignorance of the usages of polite society, but from a little
@c surprise and nervousness, consequent on this somewhat unexpected visit.
@c And I beseech you to reveal my indiscretion to no one, and especially
@c not to my Wife.  But before your Lordship enters into further
@c communications, would he deign to satisfy the curiosity
@c of one who would gladly know whence his visitor came?
@c 
@c Stranger.  From Space, from Space, Sir:  whence else?
@c 
@c I.  Pardon me, my Lord, but is not your Lordship already in Space,
@c your Lordship and his humble servant, even at this moment?
@c 
@c Stranger.  Pooh! what do you know of Space?  Define Space.
@c 
@c I.  Space, my Lord, is height and breadth indefinitely prolonged.
@c 
@c Stranger.  Exactly:  you see you do not even know what Space is. 
@c You think it is of Two Dimensions only; but I have come to announce
@c to you a Third--height, breadth, and length.
@c 
@c I.  Your Lordship is pleased to be merry.  We also speak of length
@c and height, or breadth and thickness, thus denoting Two Dimensions
@c by four names.
@c 
@c Stranger.  But I mean not only three names, but Three Dimensions.
@c 
@c I.  Would your Lordship indicate or explain to me
@c in what direction is the Third Dimension, unknown to me?
@c 
@c Stranger.  I came from it.  It is up above and down below.
@c 
@c I.  My Lord means seemingly that it is Northward and Southward.
@c 
@c Stranger.  I mean nothing of the kind.  I mean a direction
@c in which you cannot look, because you have no eye in your side.
@c 
@c I.  Pardon me, my Lord, a moment's inspection will convince your Lordship
@c that I have a perfectly luminary at the juncture of my two sides.
@c 
@c Stranger:  Yes:  but in order to see into Space you ought to have an eye,
@c not on your Perimeter, but on your side, that is, on what you would probably
@c call your inside; but we in Spaceland should call it your side.
@c 
@c I.  An eye in my inside!  An eye in my stomach!  Your Lordship jests.
@c 
@c Stranger.  I am in no jesting humour.  I tell you that I come from Space,
@c or, since you will not understand what Space means, from the Land
@c of Three Dimensions whence I but lately looked down upon your Plane
@c which you call Space forsooth.  From that position of advantage
@c I discerned all that you speak of as SOLID (by which you mean
@c "enclosed on four sides"), your houses, your churches,
@c your very chests and safes, yes even your insides and stomachs,
@c all lying open and exposed to my view.
@c 
@c I.  Such assertions are easily made, my Lord.
@c 
@c Stranger.  But not easily proved, you mean.  But I mean to prove mine.
@c 
@c When I descended here, I saw your four Sons, the Pentagons,
@c each in his apartment, and your two Grandsons the Hexagons;
@c I saw your youngest Hexagon remain a while with you and then
@c retire to his room, leaving you and your Wife alone.
@c I saw your Isosceles servants, three in number,
@c in the kitchen at supper, and the little Page
@c in the scullery.  Then I came here, and how do you think I came?
@c 
@c I.  Through the roof, I suppose.
@c 
@c Strange.  Not so.  Your roof, as you know very well, has been
@c recently repaired, and has no aperture by which even a Woman
@c could penetrate.  I tell you I come from Space.  Are you not convinced
@c by what I have told you of your children and household?
@c 
@c I.  Your Lordship must be aware that such facts touching
@c the belongings of his humble servant might be easily ascertained
@c by any one of the neighbourhood possessing your Lordship's
@c ample means of information.
@c 
@c Stranger.  (TO HIMSELF.)  What must I do?  Stay; one more
@c argument suggests itself to me.  When you see a Straight Line--
@c your wife, for example--how many Dimensions do you attribute to her?
@c 
@c I.  Your Lordship would treat me as if I were one of the vulgar who,
@c being ignorant of Mathematics, suppose that a Woman is really a Straight Line,
@c and only of One Dimension.  No, no, my Lord; we Squares are better advised,
@c and are as well aware of your Lordship that a Woman, though popularly
@c called a Straight Line, is, really and scientifically,
@c a very thin Parallelogram, possessing Two Dimensions,
@c like the rest of us, viz., length and breadth (or thickness).
@c 
@c Stranger.  But the very fact that a Line is visible implies
@c that it possesses yet another Dimension.
@c 
@c I.  My Lord, I have just acknowledged that a Woman is broad as well as long.
@c We see her length, we infer her breadth; which, though very slight,
@c is capable of measurement.
@c 
@c Stranger.  You do not understand me.  I mean that when you see a Woman,
@c you ought--besides inferring her breadth--to see her length,
@c and to SEE what we call her HEIGHT; although the last Dimension
@c is infinitesimal in your country.  If a Line were mere length
@c without "height," it would cease to occupy Space and would become invisible.
@c Surely you must recognize this?
@c 
@c I.  I must indeed confess that I do not in the least understand
@c your Lordship.  When we in Flatland see a Line, we see length
@c and BRIGHTNESS.  If the brightness disappears, the Line is extinguished,
@c and, as you say, ceases to occupy Space.  But am I to suppose that
@c your Lordship gives the brightness the title of a Dimension,
@c and that what we call "bright" you call "high"?
@c 
@c Stranger.  No, indeed.  By "height" I mean a Dimension like your length:
@c only, with you, "height" is not so easily perceptible, being extremely small.
@c 
@c I.  My Lord, your assertion is easily put to the test.  You say
@c I have a Third Dimension, which you call "height."  Now, Dimension
@c implies direction and measurement.  Do but measure my "height,"
@c or merely indicate to me the direction in which my "height" extends,
@c and I will become your convert.  Otherwise, your Lordship's
@c own understand must hold me excused.
@c 
@c Stranger.  (TO HIMSELF.)  I can do neither.  How shall I convince him?
@c Surely a plain statement of facts followed by ocular demonstration ought
@c to suffice.  --Now, Sir; listen to me.
@c 
@c You are living on a Plane.  What you style Flatland is the vast level
@c surface of what I may call a fluid, or in, the top of which you and your
@c countrymen move about, without rising above or falling below it.
@c 
@c I am not a plane Figure, but a Solid.  You call me a Circle; but in
@c reality I am not a Circle, but an infinite number of Circles, of size
@c varying from a Point to a Circle of thirteen inches in diameter,
@c one placed on the top of the other.  When I cut through your plane as
@c I am now doing, I make in your plane a section which you, very rightly,
@c call a Circle.  For even a Sphere--which is my proper name in my own
@c country--if he manifest himself at all to an inhabitant of Flatland--
@c must needs manifest himself as a Circle.
@c 
@c Do you not remember--for I, who see all things, discerned last
@c night the phantasmal vision of Lineland written upon your brain--
@c do you not remember, I say, how when you entered the realm of Lineland,
@c you were compelled to manifest yourself to the King, not as a Square,
@c but as a Line, because that Linear Realm had not Dimensions enough
@c to represent the whole of you, but only a slice or section of you?
@c In precisely the same way, your country of Two Dimensions is not spacious
@c enough to represent me, a being of Three, but can only exhibit a slice
@c or section of me, which is what you call a Circle.
@c 
@c The diminished brightness of your eye indicates incredulity.
@c But now prepare to receive proof positive of the truth of my assertions. 
@c You cannot indeed see more than one of my sections, or Circles, at a time;
@c for you have no power to raise your eye out of the plane of Flatland;
@c but you can at least see that, as I rise in Space, so my sections
@c become smaller.  See now, I will rise; and the effect upon your eye
@c will be that my Circle will become smaller and smaller till it dwindles
@c to a point and finally vanishes.
@c 
@c There was no "rising" that I could see; but he diminished and
@c finally vanished.  I winked once or twice to make sure that
@c I was not dreaming.  But it was no dream.  For from the depths
@c of nowhere came forth a hollow voice--close to my heart it seemed--
@c "Am I quite gone?  Are you convinced now?  Well, now I will gradually
@c return to Flatland and you shall see my section become larger and larger."
@c 
@c Every reader in Spaceland will easily understand that my mysterious Guest
@c was speaking the language of truth and even of simplicity.  But to me,
@c proficient though I was in Flatland Mathematics, it was by no means
@c a simple matter.  The rough diagram given above will make it clear
@c to any Spaceland child that the Sphere, ascending in the three positions
@c indicated there, must needs have manifested himself to me, or to any
@c Flatlander, as a Circle, at first of full size, then small, and at last
@c very small indeed, approaching to a Point.  But to me, although I saw
@c the facts before me, the causes were as dark as ever.  All that I could
@c comprehend was, that the Circle had made himself smaller and vanished,
@c and that he had now re-appeared and was rapidly making himself larger.
@c 
@c When he regained his original size, he heaved a deep sigh; for he
@c perceived by my silence that I had altogether failed to comprehend
@c him.  And indeed I was now inclining to the belief that he must be
@c no Circle at all, but some extremely clever juggler; or else that
@c the old wives' tales were true, and that after all there were such
@c people as Enchanters and Magicians.
@c 
@c After a long pause he muttered to himself, "One resource alone remains,
@c if I am not to resort to action.  I must try the method of Analogy."
@c Then followed a still longer silence, after which he continued our dialogue.
@c 
@c Sphere.  Tell me, Mr. Mathematician; if a Point moves Northward,
@c and leaves a luminous wake, what name would you give to the wake?
@c 
@c I.  A straight Line.
@c 
@c Sphere.  And a straight Line has how many extremities?
@c 
@c I.  Two.
@c 
@c Sphere.  Now conceive the Northward straight Line moving parallel
@c to itself, East and West, so that every point in it leaves behind
@c it the wake of a straight Line.  What name will you give to the Figure
@c thereby formed?  We will suppose that it moves through a distance equal
@c to the original straight line. --What name, I say?
@c 
@c I.  A square.
@c 
@c Sphere.  And how many sides has a Square?  How many angles?
@c 
@c I.  Four sides and four angles.
@c 
@c Sphere.  Now stretch your imagination a little, and conceive a Square
@c in Flatland, moving parallel to itself upward.
@c 
@c I.  What?  Northward?
@c 
@c Sphere.  No, not Northward; upward; out of Flatland altogether.
@c 
@c If it moved Northward, the Southern points in the Square
@c would have to move through the positions previously occupied
@c by the Northern points.  But that is not my meaning.
@c 
@c I mean that every Point in you--for you are a Square and will serve
@c the purpose of my illustration--every Point in you, that is to say
@c in what you call your inside, is to pass upwards through Space
@c in such a way that no Point shall pass through the position previously
@c occupied by any other Point; but each Point shall describe a straight
@c Line of its own.  This is all in accordance with Analogy;
@c surely it must be clear to you.
@c 
@c Restraining my impatience--for I was now under a strong temptation
@c to rush blindly at my Visitor and to precipitate him into Space,
@c or out of Flatland, anywhere, so that I could get rid of him--I replied:--
@c 
@c "And what may be the nature of the Figure which I am to shape out
@c by this motion which you are pleased to denote by the word `upward'? 
@c I presume it is describable in the language of Flatland."
@c 
@c Sphere.  Oh, certainly.  It is all plain and simple, and in strict
@c accordance with Analogy--only, by the way, you must not speak of the
@c result as being a Figure, but as a Solid.  But I will describe it to you.
@c Or rather not I, but Analogy.
@c 
@c We began with a single Point, which of course--being itself a Point--
@c has only ONE terminal Point.
@c 
@c One Point produces a Line with TWO terminal Points.
@c 
@c One Line produces a Square with FOUR terminal Points.
@c 
@c Now you can give yourself the answer to your own question:  1, 2,
@c 4, are evidently in Geometrical Progression.  What is the next number?
@c 
@c I.  Eight.
@c 
@c Sphere.  Exactly.  The one Square produces a SOMETHING-WHICH-YOU-
@c DO-NOT-AS-YET-KNOW-A-NAME-FOR-BUT-WHICH-WE-CALL-A-CUBE with EIGHT
@c terminal Points.  Now are you convinced?
@c 
@c I.  And has this Creature sides, as well as Angles or what you call
@c "terminal Points"?
@c 
@c Sphere.  Of course; and all according to Analogy.  But, by the way,
@c not what YOU call sides, but what WE call sides.  You would call them SOLIDS.
@c 
@c I.  And how many solids or sides will appertain to this Being whom
@c I am to generate by the motion of my inside in an "upward" direction,
@c and whom you call a Cube?
@c 
@c Sphere.  How can you ask?  And you a mathematician!  The side of anything
@c is always, if I may so say, one Dimension behind the thing.  Consequently,
@c as there is no Dimension behind a Point, a Point has 0 sides; a Line,
@c if I may so say, has 2 sides (for the points of a Line may be called
@c by courtesy, its sides); a Square has 4 sides; 0, 2, 4; what Progression
@c do you call that?
@c 
@c I.  Arithmetical.
@c 
@c Sphere.  And what is the next number?
@c 
@c I.  Six.
@c 
@c Sphere.  Exactly.  Then you see you have answered your own question.
@c The Cube which you will generate will be bounded by six sides,
@c that is to say, six of your insides.  You see it all now, eh?
@c 
@c "Monster," I shrieked, "be thou juggler, enchanter, dream, or
@c devil, no more will I endure thy mockeries.  Either thou or I must
@c perish."  And saying these words I precipitated myself upon him.
@c 
@c 
@c 
@c 
@c SECTION 17  How the Sphere, having in vain tried words, resorted to deeds
@c 
@c 
@c It was in vain.  I brought my hardest right angle into violent collision
@c with the Stranger, pressing on him with a force sufficient to have destroyed
@c any ordinary Circle:  but I could feel him slowly and unarrestably slipping
@c from my contact; not edging to the right nor to the left, but moving somehow
@c out of the world, and vanishing into nothing.  Soon there was a blank.
@c But still I heard the Intruder's voice.
@c 
@c Sphere.  Why will you refuse to listen to reason?  I had hoped to find
@c in you--as being a man of sense and an accomplished mathematician--
@c a fit apostle for the Gospel of the Three Dimensions, which I am allowed
@c to preach once only in a thousand years:  but now I know not how
@c to convince you.  Stay, I have it.  Deeds, and not words,
@c shall proclaim the truth.  Listen, my friend.
@c 
@c I have told you I can see from my position in Space the inside
@c of all things that you consider closed.  For example, I see in yonder
@c cupboard near which you are standing, several of what you call boxes
@c (but like everything else in Flatland, they have no tops or bottom)
@c full of money; I see also two tablets of accounts.  I am about
@c to descend into that cupboard and to bring you one of those tablets.
@c I saw you lock the cupboard half an hour ago, and I know you have
@c the key in your possession.  But I descend from Space; the doors, you see,
@c remain unmoved.  Now I am in the cupboard and am taking the tablet. 
@c Now I have it.  Now I ascent with it.
@c 
@c I rushed to the closet and dashed the door open.  One of the tablets
@c was gone.  With a mocking laugh, the Stranger appeared in the other
@c corner of the room, and at the same time the tablet appeared upon the floor.
@c I took it up.  There could be no doubt--it was the missing tablet.
@c 
@c I groaned with horror, doubting whether I was not out of my sense;
@c but the Stranger continued:  "Surely you must now see that my explanation,
@c and no other, suits the phenomena.  What you call Solid things are really
@c superficial; what you call Space is really nothing but a great Plane.
@c I am in Space, and look down upon the insides of the things of which
@c you only see the outsides.  You could leave the Plane yourself,
@c if you could but summon up the necessary volition.  A slight upward
@c or downward motion would enable you to see all that I can see.
@c 
@c "The higher I mount, and the further I go from your Plane,
@c the more I can see, though of course I see it on a smaller scale.
@c For example, I am ascending; now I can see your neighbour the Hexagon
@c and his family in their several apartments; now I see the inside of
@c the Theatre, ten doors off, from which the audience is only just departing;
@c and on the other side a Circle in his study, sitting at his books.
@c Now I shall come back to you.  And, as a crowning proof, what do
@c you say to my giving you a touch, just the least touch, in your stomach?
@c It will not seriously injure you, and the slight pain you may suffer
@c cannot be compared with the mental benefit you will receive."
@c 
@c Before I could utter a word of remonstrance, I felt a shooting pain
@c in my inside, and a demoniacal laugh seemed to issue from within me.
@c A moment afterwards the sharp agony had ceased, leaving nothing but
@c a dull ache behind, and the Stranger began to reappear, saying,
@c as he gradually increased in size, "There, I have not hurt you much,
@c have I?  If you are not convinced now, I don't know what will convince you.
@c What say you?"
@c 
@c My resolution was taken.  It seemed intolerable that I should endure
@c existence subject to the arbitrary visitations of a Magician who could
@c thus play tricks with one's very stomach.  If only I could in any way
@c manage to pin him against the wall till help came!
@c 
@c Once more I dashed my hardest angle against him, at the same time
@c alarming the whole household by my cries for aid.  I believe,
@c at the moment of my onset, the Stranger had sunk below our Plane,
@c and really found difficulty in rising.  In any case he remained motionless,
@c while I, hearing, as I thought, the sound of some help approaching,
@c pressed against him with redoubled vigor, and continued to shout
@c for assistance.
@c 
@c A convulsive shudder ran through the Sphere.  "This must not be,"
@c I thought I heard him say:  "either he must listen to reason,
@c or I must have recourse to the last resource of civilization."
@c Then, addressing me in a louder tone, he hurriedly exclaimed, "Listen:
@c no stranger must witness what you have witnessed.  Send your Wife back
@c at once, before she enters the apartment.  The Gospel of Three Dimensions
@c must not be thus frustrated.  Not thus must the fruits of one thousand
@c years of waiting be thrown away.  I hear her coming.  Back! back! 
@c Away from me, or you must go with me--wither you know not--into
@c the Land of Three Dimensions!"
@c 
@c "Fool!  Madman!  Irregular!" I exclaimed; "never will I release thee;
@c thou shalt pay the penalty of thine impostures."
@c 
@c "Ha!  Is it come to this?" thundered the Stranger:  "then meet your fate:
@c out of your Plane you go.  Once, twice, thrice!  `Tis done!"
@c 
@c 
@c 
@c 
@c SECTION 18  How I came to Spaceland, and what I saw there
@c 
@c 
@c An unspeakable horror seized me.  There was a darkness; then a dizzy,
@c sickening sensation of sight that was not like seeing; I saw a Line
@c that was no Line; Space that was not Space:  I was myself, and not myself.
@c When I could find voice, I shrieked loud in agony, "Either this is madness
@c or it is Hell."  "It is neither, calmly replied the voice of the Sphere,
@c "it is Knowledge; it is Three Dimensions:  open your eye once again
@c and try to look steadily."
@c 
@c I looked, and, behold, a new world!  There stood before me,
@c visibly incorporate, all that I had before inferred, conjectured,
@c dreamed, of perfect Circular beauty.  What seemed the centre
@c of the Stranger's form lay open to my view:  yet I could see no heart,
@c lungs, nor arteries, only a beautiful harmonious Something--
@c for which I had no words; but you, my Readers in Spaceland,
@c would call it the surface of the Sphere.
@c 
@c Prostrating myself mentally before my Guide, I cried, "How is it,
@c O divine ideal of consummate loveliness and wisdom that I see thy
@c inside, and yet cannot discern thy heart, thy lungs, thy arteries,
@c thy liver?"  "What you think you see, you see not," he replied;
@c "it is not giving to you, nor to any other Being, to behold
@c my internal parts. I am of a different order of Beings
@c from those in Flatland.  Were I a Circle, you could
@c discern my intestines, but I am a Being, composed
@c as I told you before, of many Circles, the Many in the One,
@c called in this country a Sphere.  And, just as the outside
@c of a Cube is a Square, so the outside of a Sphere represents
@c the appearance of a Circle."
@c 
@c Bewildered though I was by my Teacher's enigmatic utterance,
@c I no longer chafed against it, but worshipped him in silent adoration.
@c He continued, with more mildness in his voice.  "Distress not yourself
@c if you cannot at first understand the deeper mysteries of Spaceland.
@c By degrees they will dawn upon you.  Let us begin by casting back
@c a glance at the region whence you came.  Return with me a while to
@c the plains of Flatland and I will shew you that which you have often
@c reasoned and thought about, but never seen with the sense of sight--
@c a visible angle."  "Impossible!" I cried; but, the Sphere leading the way,
@c I followed as if in a dream, till once more his voice arrested me:
@c "Look yonder, and behold your own Pentagonal house, and all its inmates."
@c 
@c I looked below, and saw with my physical eye all that domestic
@c individuality which I had hitherto merely inferred with
@c the understanding.  And how poor and shadowy was the inferred conjecture
@c in comparison with the reality which I now behold!  My four Sons
@c calmly asleep in the North-Western rooms, my two orphan Grandsons
@c to the South; the Servants, the Butler, my Daughter, all in their
@c several apartments.  Only my affection Wife, alarmed by my continued
@c absence, had quitter her room and was roving up and down in the Hall,
@c anxiously awaiting my return.  Also the Page, aroused by my cries,
@c had left his room, and under pretext of ascertaining whether I had
@c fallen somewhere in a faint, was prying into the cabinet in my study.
@c All this I could now SEE, not merely infer; and as we came nearer
@c and nearer, I could discern even the contents of my cabinet, and the
@c two chests of gold, and the tablets of which the Sphere had made mention.
@c 
@c Touched by my Wife's distress, I would have sprung downward
@c to reassure her, but I found myself incapable of motion.
@c "Trouble not yourself about your Wife," said my Guide:
@c "she will not be long left in anxiety; meantime,
@c let us take a survey of Flatland."
@c 
@c Once more I felt myself rising through space.  It was even as
@c the Sphere had said.  The further we receded from the object we beheld,
@c the larger became the field of vision.  My native city, with
@c the interior of every house and every creature therein, lay open
@c to my view in miniature.  We mounted higher, and lo, the secrets
@c of the earth, the depths of the mines and inmost caverns of the hills,
@c were bared before me.
@c 
@c Awestruck at the sight of the mysteries of the earth, thus unveiled
@c before my unworthy eye, I said to my Companion, "Behold, I am become
@c as a God.  For the wise men in our country say that to see all things,
@c or as they express it, OMNIVIDENCE, is the attribute of God alone."
@c There was something of scorn in the voice of my Teacher as he made answer:
@c "it is so indeed?  Then the very pick-pockets and cut-throats
@c of my country are to be worshipped by your wise men as being Gods:
@c for there is not one of them that does not see as much as you see now.
@c But trust me, your wise men are wrong."
@c 
@c I.  Then is omnividence the attribute of others besides Gods?
@c 
@c Sphere.  I do not know.  But, if a pick-pocket or a cut-throat
@c of our country can see everything that is in your country, surely
@c that is no reason why the pick-pocket or cut-throat should be accepted
@c by you as a God.  This omnividence, as you call it--it is not a common word
@c in Spaceland--does it make you more just, more merciful, less selfish,
@c more loving?  Not in the least.  Then how does it make you more divine?
@c 
@c I.  "More merciful, more loving!"  But these are the qualities of women!
@c And we know that a Circle is a higher Being than a Straight Line,
@c in so far as knowledge and wisdom are more to be esteemed than mere affection.
@c 
@c Sphere.  It is not for me to classify human faculties according to merit.
@c Yet many of the best and wisest in Spaceland think more of the affections
@c than of the understand, more of your despised Straight Lines than of your
@c belauded Circles.  But enough of this.  Look yonder.  Do you know
@c that building?
@c 
@c I looked, and afar off I saw an immense Polygonal structure,
@c in which I recognized the General Assembly Hall of the States
@c of Flatland, surrounded by dense lines of Pentagonal buildings
@c at right angles to each other, which I knew to be streets;
@c and I perceived that I was approaching the great Metropolis.
@c 
@c "Here we descend," said my Guide.  It was now morning, the first
@c hour of the first day of the two thousandth year of our era.
@c Acting, as was their wont, in strict accordance with precedent,
@c the highest Circles of the realm were meeting in solemn conclave,
@c as they had met on the first hour of the first day of the year 1000,
@c and also on the first hour of the first day of the year 0.
@c 
@c The minutes of the previous meetings were now read by one whom
@c I at once recognized as my brother, a perfectly Symmetrical Square,
@c and the Chief Clerk of the High Council.  It was found recorded on
@c each occasion that:  "Whereas the States had been troubled by divers
@c ill-intentioned persons pretending to have received revelations
@c from another World, and professing to produce demonstrations whereby
@c they had instigated to frenzy both themselves and others, it had been
@c for this cause unanimously resolved by the Grand Council that on the
@c first day of each millenary, special injunctions be sent to the Prefects
@c in the several districts of Flatland, to make strict search for such
@c misguided persons, and without formality of mathematical examination,
@c to destroy all such as were Isosceles of any degree, to scourge
@c and imprison any regular Triangle, to cause any Square or Pentagon
@c to be sent to the district Asylum, and to arrest any one of higher rank,
@c sending him straightway to the Capital to be examined and judged
@c by the Council."
@c 
@c "You hear your fate," said the Sphere to me, while the Council
@c was passing for the third time the formal resolution.  "Death or
@c imprisonment awaits the Apostle of the Gospel of Three Dimensions." 
@c "Not so," replied I, "the matter is now so clear to me, the nature of real
@c space so palpable, that methinks I could make a child understand it.
@c Permit me but to descend at this moment and enlighten them."
@c "Not yet," said my Guide, "the time will come for that.
@c Meantime I must perform my mission.  Stay thou there in thy place."
@c Saying these words, he leaped with great dexterity into the sea
@c (if I may so call it) of Flatland, right in the midst of the ring
@c of Counsellors.  "I come," said he, "to proclaim that there is a land
@c of Three Dimensions."
@c 
@c I could see many of the younger Counsellors start back in manifest horror,
@c as the Sphere's circular section widened before them.  But on a sign from
@c the presiding Circle--who shewed not the slightest alarm or surprise--
@c six Isosceles of a low type from six different quarters rushed upon the Sphere.
@c "We have him," they cried; "No; yes; we have him still! he's going! he's gone!"
@c 
@c "My Lords," said the President to the Junior Circles of the Council,
@c "there is not the slightest need for surprise; the secret archives,
@c to which I alone have access, tell me that a similar occurrence
@c happened on the last two millennial commencements.  You will,
@c of course, say nothing of these trifles outside the Cabinet."
@c 
@c Raising his voice, he now summoned the guards.  "Arrest the policemen;
@c gag them.  You know your duty."  After he had consigned to their fate
@c the wretched policemen--ill-fated and unwilling witnesses
@c of a State-secret which they were not to be permitted to reveal--
@c he again addressed the Counsellors.  "My Lords, the business of the
@c Council being concluded, I have only to wish you a happy New Year."
@c Before departing, he expressed, at some length, to the Clerk,
@c my excellent but most unfortunate brother, his sincere regret that,
@c in accordance with precedent and for the sake of secrecy, he must condemn
@c him to perpetual imprisonment, but added his satisfaction that,
@c unless some mention were made by him of that day's incident,
@c his life would be spared.
@c 
@c 
@c 
@c 
@c SECTION 19  How, though the Sphere shewed me other mysteries of
@c             Spaceland, I still desire more; and what came of it
@c 
@c 
@c When I saw my poor brother led away to imprisonment, I attempted to leap
@c down into the Council Chamber, desiring to intercede on his behalf,
@c or at least bid him farewell.  But I found that I had no motion of my own.
@c I absolutely depended on the volition of my Guide, who said in gloomy tones,
@c "Heed not thy brother; haply thou shalt have ample time hereafter
@c to condole with him.  Follow me."
@c 
@c Once more we ascended into space.  "Hitherto," said the Sphere,
@c "I have shewn you naught save Plane Figures and their interiors.
@c Now I must introduce you to Solids, and reveal to you the plan upon which
@c they are constructed.  Behold this multitude of moveable square cards.
@c See, I put one on another, not, as you supposed, Northward of the other,
@c but ON the other.  Now a second, now a third.  See, I am building up
@c a Solid by a multitude of Squares parallel to one another.
@c Now the Solid is complete, being as high as it is long and broad,
@c and we call it a Cube."
@c 
@c "Pardon me, my Lord," replied I; "but to my eye the appearance
@c is as of an Irregular Figure whose inside is laid open to view;
@c in other words, methinks I see no Solid, but a Plane such as we
@c infer in Flatland; only of an Irregularity which betokens some
@c monstrous criminal, so that the very sight of it is painful to my eyes."
@c 
@c "True," said the Sphere; "it appears to you a Plane, because you
@c are not accustomed to light and shade and perspective; just as in
@c Flatland a Hexagon would appear a Straight Line to one who has not
@c the Art of Sight Recognition.  But in reality it is a Solid,
@c as you shall learn by the sense of Feeling."
@c 
@c He then introduced me to the Cube, and I found that this marvellous
@c Being was indeed no Plane, but a Solid; and that he was endowed with
@c six plane sides and eight terminal points called solid angles;
@c and I remembered the saying of the Sphere that just such a Creature
@c as this would be formed by the Square moving, in Space, parallel to himself:
@c and I rejoiced to think that so insignificant a Creature as I could
@c in some sense be called the Progenitor of so illustrious an offspring.
@c 
@c But still I could not fully understand the meaning of what my Teacher
@c had told me concerning "light" and "shade" and "perspective";
@c and I did not hesitate to put my difficulties before him.
@c 
@c Were I to give the Sphere's explanation of these matters, succinct
@c and clear though it was, it would be tedious to an inhabitant of Space,
@c who knows these things already.  Suffice it, that by his lucid statements,
@c and by changing the position of objects and lights, and by allowing me
@c to feel the several objects and even his own sacred Person, he at last
@c made all things clear to me, so that I could now readily distinguish
@c between a Circle and a Sphere, a Plane Figure and a Solid.
@c 
@c This was the Climax, the Paradise, of my strange eventful History. 
@c Henceforth I have to relate the story of my miserable Fall:--most miserable,
@c yet surely most undeserved!  For why should the thirst for knowledge
@c be aroused, only to be disappointed and punished?  My volition shrinks
@c from the painful task of recalling my humiliation; yet, like a second
@c Prometheus, I will endure this and worse, if by any means I may arouse
@c in the interiors of Plane and Solid Humanity a spirit of rebellion against
@c the Conceit which would limit our Dimensions to Two or Three or any number
@c short of Infinity.  Away then with all personal considerations!
@c Let me continue to the end, as I began, without further digressions
@c or anticipations, pursuing the plain path of dispassionate History.
@c The exact facts, the exact words,--and they are burnt in upon my brain,
@c --shall be set down without alteration of an iota; and let my Readers
@c judge between me and Destiny.
@c 
@c The Sphere would willingly have continued his lessons by
@c indoctrinating me in the conformation of all regular Solids,
@c Cylinders, Cones, Pyramids, Pentahedrons, Hexahedrons, Dodecahedrons,
@c and Spheres:  but I ventured to interrupt him.  Not that I was wearied
@c of knowledge.  On the contrary, I thirsted for yet deeper and fuller
@c draughts than he was offering to me.
@c 
@c "Pardon me," said I, "O Thou Whom I must no longer address as the Perfection
@c of all Beauty; but let me beg thee to vouchsafe thy servant a slight
@c of thine interior."
@c 
@c Sphere.  My what?
@c 
@c I.  Thine interior:  thy stomach, thy intestines.
@c 
@c Sphere.  Whence this ill-timed impertinent request?  And what mean
@c you by saying that I am no longer the Perfection of all Beauty?
@c 
@c I.  My Lord, your own wisdom has taught me to aspire to One even more great,
@c more beautiful, and more closely approximate to Perfection than yourself.
@c As you yourself, superior to all Flatland forms, combine many Circles in One,
@c so doubtless there is One above you who combines many Spheres
@c in One Supreme Existence, surpassing even the Solids of Spaceland.
@c And even as we, who are now in Space, look down on Flatland
@c and see the insides of all things, so of a certainty there is yet
@c above us some higher, purer region, whither thou dost surely purpose
@c to lead me--O Thou Whom I shall always call, everywhere and in all Dimensions,
@c my Priest, Philosopher, and Friend--some yet more spacious Space,
@c some more dimensionable Dimensionality, from the vantage-ground
@c of which we shall look down together upon the revealed insides
@c of Solid things, and where thine own intestines, and those
@c of thy kindred Spheres, will lie exposed to the view of the poor
@c wandering exile from Flatland, to whom so much has already been vouchsafed.
@c 
@c Sphere.  Pooh!  Stuff!  Enough of this trifling!  The time is short,
@c and much remains to be done before you are fit to proclaim the Gospel
@c of Three Dimensions to your blind benighted countrymen in Flatland.
@c 
@c I.  Nay, gracious Teacher, deny me not what I know it is in thy
@c power to reform.  Grant me but one glimpse of thine interior,
@c and I am satisfied for ever, remaining henceforth thy docile pupil,
@c thy unemacipable slave, ready to receive all thy teachings and to feed
@c upon the words that fall from thy lips.
@c 
@c Sphere.  Well, then, to content and silence you, let me say at once,
@c I would shew you what you wish if I could; but I cannot.  Would you
@c have me turn my stomach inside out to oblige you?
@c 
@c I.  But my Lord has shewn me the intestines of all my countrymen in
@c the Land of Two Dimensions by taking me with him into the Land of Three.
@c What therefore more easy than now to take his servant on a second journey
@c into the blessed region of the Fourth Dimension, where I shall look down
@c with him once more upon this land of Three Dimensions, and see the inside
@c of every three-dimensioned house, the secrets of the solid earth,
@c the treasures of the mines of Spaceland, and the intestines of every
@c solid living creature, even the noble and adorable Spheres.
@c 
@c Sphere.  But where is this land of Four Dimensions?
@c 
@c I.  I know not:  but doubtless my Teacher knows.
@c 
@c Sphere.  Not I.  There is no such land.  The very idea of it is
@c utterly inconceivable.
@c 
@c I.  Not inconceivable, my Lord, to me, and therefore still less
@c inconceivable to my Master.  Nay, I despair not that, even here,
@c in this region of Three Dimensions, your Lordship's art may make
@c the Fourth Dimension visible to me; just as in the Land of
@c Two Dimensions my Teacher's skill would fain have opened the eyes
@c of his blind servant to the invisible presence of a Third Dimension,
@c though I saw it not.
@c 
@c Let me recall the past.  Was I not taught below that when I saw a Line
@c and inferred a Plane, I in reality saw a Third unrecognized Dimension,
@c not the same as brightness, called "height"?  And does it not
@c now follow that, in this region, when I see a Plane and infer a Solid,
@c I really see a Fourth unrecognized Dimension, not the same as colour,
@c but existent, though infinitesimal and incapable of measurement?
@c 
@c And besides this, there is the Argument from Analogy of Figures.
@c 
@c Sphere.  Analogy!  Nonsense:  what analogy?
@c 
@c I.  Your Lordship tempts his servant to see whether he remembers
@c the revelations imparted to him.  Trifle not with me, my Lord;
@c I crave, I thirst, for more knowledge.  Doubtless we cannot SEE that
@c other higher Spaceland now, because we have no eye in our stomachs. 
@c But, just as there WAS the realm of Flatland, though that poor puny
@c Lineland Monarch could neither turn to left nor right to discern it,
@c and just as there WAS close at hand, and touching my frame, the land
@c of Three Dimensions, though I, blind senseless wretch, had no power
@c to touch it, no eye in my interior to discern it, so of a surety there
@c is a Fourth Dimension, which my Lord perceives with the inner eye
@c of thought.  And that it must exist my Lord himself has taught me.
@c Or can he have forgotten what he himself imparted to his servant?
@c 
@c In One Dimension, did not a moving Point produce a Line with TWO
@c terminal points?
@c 
@c In Two Dimensions, did not a moving Line produce a Square with FOUR
@c terminal points?
@c 
@c In Three Dimensions, did not a moving Square produce--did not
@c this eye of mine behold it--that blessed Being, a Cube, with EIGHT
@c terminal points?
@c 
@c And in Four Dimensions shall not a moving Cube--alas, for Analogy,
@c and alas for the Progress of Truth, if it be not so--shall not,
@c I say, the motion of a divine Cube result in a still more divine
@c Organization with SIXTEEN terminal points?
@c 
@c Behold the infallible confirmation of the Series, 2, 4, 8, 16:  is
@c not this a Geometrical Progression?  Is not this--if I might quote
@c my Lord's own words--"strictly according to Analogy"?
@c 
@c Again, was I not taught by my Lord that as in a Line there are TWO
@c bounding Points, and in a Square there are FOUR bounding Lines,
@c so in a Cube there must be SIX bounding Squares?  Behold once more
@c the confirming Series, 2, 4, 6:  is not this an Arithmetical Progression?
@c And consequently does it not of necessity follow that the more divine
@c offspring of the divine Cube in the Land of Four Dimensions,
@c must have 8 bounding Cubes: and is not this also, as my Lord
@c has taught me to believe, "strictly according to Analogy"?
@c O, my Lord, my Lord, behold, I cast myself in faith upon conjecture,
@c not knowing the facts; and I appeal to your Lordship to confirm
@c or deny my logical anticipations.  If I am wrong, I yield,
@c and will no longer demand a Fourth Dimension; but,
@c if I am right, my Lord will listen to reason.
@c 
@c I ask therefore, is it, or is it not, the fact, that ere now your
@c countrymen also have witnessed the descent of Beings of a higher order
@c than their own, entering closed rooms, even as your Lordship entered mine,
@c without the opening of doors or windows, and appearing and vanishing at will?
@c On the reply to this question I am ready to stake everything.  Deny it,
@c and I am henceforth silent.  Only vouchsafe an answer.
@c 
@c Sphere (AFTER A PAUSE).  It is reported so.  But men are divided
@c in opinion as to the facts.  And even granting the facts, they explain
@c them in different ways.  And in any case, however great may be the
@c number of different explanations, no one has adopted or suggested
@c the theory of a Fourth Dimension.  Therefore, pray have done with
@c this trifling, and let us return to business.
@c 
@c I.  I was certain of it.  I was certain that my anticipations
@c would be fulfilled.  And now have patience with me and answer me
@c yet one more question, best of Teachers!  Those who have thus appeared--
@c no one knows whence--and have returned--no one knows whither--
@c have they also contracted their sections and vanished somehow into
@c that more Spacious Space, whither I now entreat you to conduct me?
@c 
@c Sphere (MOODILY).  They have vanished, certainly--if they ever appeared.
@c But most people say that these visions arose from the thought--you will not
@c understand me--from the brain; from the perturbed angularity of the Seer.
@c 
@c I.  Say they so?  Oh, believe them not.  Or if it indeed be so,
@c that this other SPace is really Thoughtland, then take me to that
@c blessed Region where I in Thought shall see the insides of all solid
@c things.  There, before my ravished eye, a Cube moving in some
@c altogether new direction, but strictly according to Analogy, so as to
@c make every particle of his interior pass through a new kind of Space,
@c with a wake of its own--shall create a still more perfect perfection
@c than himself, with sixteen terminal Extra-solid angles, and Eight
@c solid Cubes for his Perimeter.  And once there, shall we stay our
@c upward course?  In that blessed region of Four Dimensions, shall we
@c linger at the threshold of the Fifth, and not enter therein?  Ah, no! 
@c Let us rather resolve that our ambition shall soar with our corporal
@c ascent.  Then, yielding to our intellectual onset, the gates of the
@c Six Dimension shall fly open; after that a Seventh, and then an Eighth--
@c 
@c How long I should have continued I know not.  In vain did the Sphere,
@c in his voice of thunder, reiterate his command of silence,
@c and threaten me with the direst penalties if I persisted.
@c Nothing could stem the flood of my ecstatic aspirations.
@c Perhaps I was to blame; but indeed I was intoxicated with
@c the recent draughts of Truth to which he himself had introduced me.
@c However, the end was not long in coming.  My words were cut short
@c by a crash outside, and a simultaneous crash inside me,
@c which impelled me through space with a velocity that precluded speech.
@c Down! down! down!  I was rapidly descending; and I knew that return
@c to Flatland was my doom.  One glimpse, one last and never-to-be-forgotten
@c glimpse I had of that dull level wilderness--which was now to become
@c my Universe again-- spread out before my eye.  Then a darkness.
@c Then a final, all- consummating thunder-peal; and, when I came to myself,
@c I was once more a common creeping Square, in my Study at home,
@c listening to the Peace- Cry of my approaching Wife.
@c 
@c 
@c 
@c 
@c SECTION 20  How the Sphere encouraged me in a Vision.
@c 
@c 
@c Although I had less than a minute for reflection, I felt, by a kind
@c of instinct, that I must conceal my experiences from my Wife.
@c Not that I apprehended, at the moment, any danger from her divulging
@c my secret, but I knew that to any Woman in Flatland the narrative of my
@c adventures must needs be unintelligible.  So I endeavoured to reassure
@c her by some story, invented for the occasion, that I had accidentally
@c fallen through the trap-door of the cellar, and had there lain stunned.
@c 
@c The Southward attraction in our country is so slight that even
@c to a Woman my tale necessarily appeared extraordinary and well-nigh
@c incredible; but my Wife, whose good sense far exceeds that of the
@c average of her Sex, and who perceived that I was unusually excited,
@c did not argue with me on the subject, but insisted that I was will
@c and required repose.  I was glad of an excuse for retiring to my chamber
@c to think quietly over what had happened.  When I was at last by myself,
@c a drowsy sensation fell on me; but before my eyes closed I endeavoured
@c to reproduce the Third Dimension, and especially the process by which
@c a Cube is constructed through the motion of a Square.  It was not
@c so clear as I could have wished; but I remembered that it must be
@c "Upward, and yet not Northward," and I determined steadfastly
@c to retain these words as the clue which, if firmly grasped,
@c could not fail to guide me to the solution.  So mechanically
@c repeating, like a charm, the words, "Upward, yet not Northward,"
@c I fell into a sound refreshing sleep.
@c 
@c During my slumber I had a dream.  I thought I was once more
@c by the side of the Sphere, whose lustrous hue betokened that
@c he had exchanged his wrath against me for perfectly placability.
@c We were moving together towards a bright but infinitesimally small Point,
@c to which my Master directed my attention.  As we approached, methought
@c there issued from it a slight humming noise as from one of your Spaceland
@c bluebottles, only less resonant by far, so slight indeed that even
@c in the perfect stillness of the Vacuum through which we soared,
@c the sound reached not our ears till we checked our flight
@c at a distant from it of something under twenty human diagonals.
@c 
@c "Look yonder," said my Guide, "in Flatland thou hast lived;
@c of Lineland thou hast received a vision; thou hast soared with me
@c to the heights of Spaceland; now,, in order to complete the range
@c of thy experience, I conduct thee downward to the lowest depth of existence,
@c even to the realm of Pointland, the Abyss of No dimensions.
@c 
@c "Behold yon miserable creature.  That Point is a Being like ourselves,
@c but confined to the non-dimensional Gulf.  He is himself his own World,
@c his own Universe; of any other than himself he can form no conception;
@c he knows not Length, nor Breadth, nor Height, for he has had no
@c experience of them; he has no cognizance even of the number Two;
@c nor has he a thought of Plurality; for he is himself his One and All,
@c being really Nothing.  Yet mark his perfect self-contentment,
@c and hence learn his lesson, that to be self-contented is to be vile
@c and ignorant, and that to aspire is better than to be blindly
@c and impotently happy.  Now listen."
@c 
@c He ceased; and there arose from the little buzzing creature a tiny,
@c low, monotonous, but distinct tinkling, as from one of your Spaceland
@c phonographs, from which I caught these words, "Infinite beatitude
@c of existence!  It is; and there is nothing else beside It."
@c 
@c "What," said I, "does the puny creature mean by `it'?"  "He means
@c himself," said the Sphere:  "have you not noticed before now,
@c that babies and babyish people who cannot distinguish themselves
@c from the world, speak of themselves in the Third Person?  But hush!"
@c 
@c "It fills all Space," continued the little soliloquizing Creature,
@c "and what It fills, It is.  What It thinks, that It utters;
@c and what It utters, that It hears; and It itself is Thinker, Utterer,
@c Hearer, THought, Word, Audition; it is the One, and yet the All in All.
@c Ah, the happiness, ah, the happiness of Being!"
@c 
@c "Can you not startle the little thing out of its complacency?" said I.
@c "Tell it what it really is, as you told me; reveal to it the narrow
@c limitations of Pointland, and lead it up to something higher."
@c "That is no easy task," said my Master; "try you."
@c 
@c Hereon, raising by voice to the uttermost, I addressed the Point as follows:
@c 
@c "Silence, silence, contemptible Creature.  You call yourself the
@c All in All, but you are the Nothing:  your so-called Universe is a
@c mere speck in a Line, and a Line is a mere shadow as compared with--" 
@c "Hush, hush, you have said enough," interrupted the Sphere, "now listen,
@c and mark the effect of your harangue on the King of Pointland."
@c 
@c The lustre of the Monarch, who beamed more brightly than ever upon
@c hearing my words, shewed clearly that he retained his complacency;
@c and I had hardly ceased when he took up his strain again.  "Ah,
@c the joy, ah, the joy of Thought1  What can It not achieve by thinking!
@c Its own Thought coming to Itself, suggestive of its disparagement,
@c thereby to enhance Its happiness!  Sweet rebellion stirred up to result
@c in triumph!  Ah, the divine creative power of the All in One!
@c Ah, the joy, the joy of Being!"
@c 
@c "You see," said my Teacher, "how little your words have done.
@c So far as the Monarch understand them at all, he accepts them as his own--
@c for he cannot conceive of any other except himself--and plumes himself
@c upon the variety of `Its Thought' as an instance of creative Power.
@c Let us leave this God of Pointland to the ignorant fruition of his
@c omnipresence and omniscience:  nothing that you or I can do can rescue
@c him from his self-satisfaction."
@c 
@c After this, as we floated gently back to Flatland, I could hear
@c the mild voice of my Companion pointing the moral of my vision,
@c and stimulating me to aspire, and to teach others to aspire.
@c He had been angered at first--he confessed--by my ambition to soar
@c to Dimensions above the Third; but, since then, he had received fresh
@c insight, and he was not too proud to acknowledge his error to a Pupil. 
@c Then he proceeded to initiate me into mysteries yet higher than those
@c I had witnessed, shewing me how to construct Extra-Solids by the motion
@c of Solids, and Double Extra-Solids by the motion of Extra-Solids,
@c and all "strictly according to Analogy," all by methods so simple,
@c so easy, as to be patent even to the Female Sex.
@c 
@c 
@c 
@c 
@c SECTION 21  How I tried to teach the Theory of Three Dimensions
@c             to my Grandson, and with what success
@c 
@c 
@c I awoke rejoicing, and began to reflect on the glorious career before me.
@c I would go forth, methought, at once, and evangelize the whole of Flatland.
@c Even to Women and Soldiers should the Gospel of Three Dimensions be proclaimed.
@c I would begin with my Wife.
@c 
@c Just as I had decided on the plan of my operations, I heard the sound
@c of many voices in the street commanding silence.  Then followed a louder voice.
@c It was a herald's proclamation.  Listening attentively, I recognized the words
@c of the Resolution of the Council, enjoining the arrest, imprisonment,
@c or execution of any one who should pervert the minds of people by delusions,
@c and by professing to have received revelations from another World.
@c 
@c I reflected.  This danger was not to be trifled with.  It would
@c be better to avoid it by omitting all mention of my Revelation,
@c and by proceeding on the path of Demonstration--which after all,
@c seemed so simple and so conclusive that nothing would be lost by
@c discarding the former means.  "Upward, not Northward"--was the clue to
@c the whole proof.  It had seemed to me fairly clear before I fell asleep;
@c and when I first awoke, fresh from my dream, it had appeared as patent
@c as Arithmetic; but somehow it did not seem to me quite so obvious now. 
@c Though my Wife entered the room opportunely at just that moment,
@c I decided, after we had exchanged a few words of commonplace conversation,
@c not to begin with her.
@c 
@c My Pentagonal Sons were men of character and standing, and physicians
@c of no mean reputation, but not great in mathematics, and, in that respect,
@c unfit for my purpose.  But it occurred to me that a young and docile Hexagon,
@c with a mathematical turn, would be a most suitable pupil.  Why therefore
@c not make my first experiment with my little precocious Grandson,
@c whose casual remarks on the meaning of three-to-the-third had met
@c with the approval of the Sphere?  Discussing the matter with him,
@c a mere boy, I should be in perfect safety; for he would know nothing
@c of the Proclamation of the Council; whereas I could not feel sure
@c that my Sons--so greatly did their patriotism and reverence
@c for the Circles predominate over mere blind affection--
@c might not feel compelled to hand me over to the Prefect,
@c if they found me seriously maintaining the seditious
@c heresy of the Third Dimension.
@c 
@c But the first thing to be done was to satisfy in some way the curiosity
@c of my Wife, who naturally wished to know something of the reasons
@c for which the Circle had desired that mysterious interview,
@c and of the means by which he had entered the house.  Without entering
@c into the details of the elaborate account I gave her,--an account,
@c I fear, not quite so consistent with truth as my Readers in Spaceland
@c might desire,--I must be content with saying that I succeeded
@c at last in persuading her to return quietly to her household duties
@c without eliciting from me any reference to the World of Three Dimensions.
@c This done, I immediately sent for my Grandson; for, to confess the truth,
@c I felt that all that I had seen and heard was in some strange way slipping
@c away from me, like the image of a half-grasped, tantalizing dream,
@c and I longed to essay my skill in making a first disciple.
@c 
@c When my Grandson entered the room I carefully secured the door. 
@c Then, sitting down by his side and taking our mathematical tablets,--
@c or, as you would call them, Lines--I told him we would resume
@c the lesson of yesterday.  I taught him once more how a Point by motion
@c in One Dimension produces a Line, and how a straight Line in Two
@c Dimensions produces a Square.  After this, forcing a laugh, I said,
@c "And now, you scamp, you wanted to make believe that a Square may in
@c the same way by motion `Upward, not Northward' produce another figure,
@c a sort of extra square in Three Dimensions.  Say that again, you young rascal."
@c 
@c At this moment we heard once more the herald's "O yes! O yes!"
@c outside in the street proclaiming the REsolution of the Council. 
@c Young though he was, my Grandson--who was unusually intelligent
@c for his age, and bred up in perfect reverence for the authority
@c of the Circles--took in the situation with an acuteness for which
@c I was quite unprepared.  He remained silent till the last words
@c of the Proclamation had died away, and then, bursting into tears,
@c "Dear Grandpapa," he said, "that was only my fun, and of course I meant
@c nothing at all by it; and we did not know anything then about the new Law;
@c and I don't think I said anything about the Third Dimension; and I am sure
@c I did not say one word about `Upward, not Northward,' for that would be
@c such nonsense, you know.  How could a thing move Upward, and not Northward?
@c Upward and not Northward!  Even if I were a baby, I could not be so absurd
@c as that.  How silly it is!  Ha! ha! ha!"
@c "Not at all silly," said I, losing my temper; "here for example,
@c I take this Square," and, at the word, I grasped a moveable Square,
@c which was lying at hand--"and I move it, you see, not Northward but
@c --yes, I move it Upward--that is to say, Northward but I move it
@c somewhere--not exactly like this, but somehow --"  Here I brought
@c my sentence to an inane conclusion, shaking the Square about in
@c a purposeless manner, much to the amusement of my Grandson, who burst
@c out laughing louder than ever, and declared that I was not teaching
@c him, but joking with him; and so saying he unlocked the door and ran
@c out of the room.  Thus ended my first attempt to convert a pupil to
@c the Gospel of Three Dimensions.
@c 
@c 
@c 
@c 
@c SECTION 22  How I then tried to diffuse the Theory of Three
@c             Dimensions by other means, and of the result
@c 
@c 
@c My failure with my Grandson did not encourage me to communicate
@c my secret to others of my household; yet neither was I led by it
@c to despair of success.  Only I saw that I must not wholly rely on
@c the catch-phrase, "Upward, not Northward," but must rather endeavour
@c to seek a demonstration by setting before the public a clear view
@c of the whole subject; and for this purpose it seemed necessary
@c to resort to writing.
@c 
@c So I devoted several months in privacy to the composition
@c of a treatise on the mysteries of Three Dimensions.  Only,
@c with the view of evading the Law, if possible, I spoke not
@c of a physical Dimension, but of a Thoughtland whence, in theory,
@c a Figure could look down upon Flatland and see simultaneously
@c the insides of all things, and where it was possible that
@c there might be supposed to exist a Figure environed,
@c as it were, with six Squares, and containing eight terminal Points.
@c But in writing this book I found myself sadly hampered by
@c the impossibility of drawing such diagrams as were necessary
@c for my purpose:  for of course, in our country of Flatland,
@c there are no tablets but Lines, and no diagrams but Lines,
@c all in one straight Line and only distinguishable by difference
@c of size and brightness; so that, when I had finished my treatise
@c (which I entitled, "Through Flatland to Thoughtland")
@c I could not feel certain that many would understand my meaning.
@c 
@c Meanwhile my wife was under a cloud.  All pleasures palled upon me;
@c all sights tantalized and tempted me to outspoken treason, because
@c I could not compare what I saw in Two Dimensions with what it really
@c was if seen in Three, and could hardly refrain from making my comparisons
@c aloud.  I neglected my clients and my own business to give myself
@c to the contemplation of the mysteries which I had once beheld,
@c yet which I could impart to no one, and found daily more difficult
@c to reproduce even before my own mental vision.
@c One day, about eleven months after my return from Spaceland, I tried
@c to see a Cube with my eye closed, but failed; and though I succeeded
@c afterwards, I was not then quite certain (nor have I been ever afterwards)
@c that I had exactly realized the original.  This made me more melancholy
@c than before, and determined me to take some step; yet what, I knew not.
@c I felt that I would have been willing to sacrifice my life for the Cause,
@c if thereby I could have produced conviction.  But if I could not convince
@c my Grandson, how could I convince the highest and most developed Circles
@c in the land?
@c 
@c And yet at times my spirit was too strong for me, and I gave vent
@c to dangerous utterances.  Already I was considered heterodox if not
@c treasonable, and I was keenly alive to the danger of my position;
@c nevertheless I could not at times refrain from bursting out into
@c suspicious or half-seditious utterances, even among the highest
@c Polygonal or Circular society.  When, for example, the question arose
@c about the treatment of those lunatics who said that they had received
@c the power of seeing the insides of things, I would quote the saying
@c of an ancient Circle, who declared that prophets and inspired people
@c are always considered by the majority to be mad; and I could not help
@c occasionally dropping such expressions as "the eye that discerns
@c the interiors of things," and "the all-seeing land"; once or twice
@c I even let fall the forbidden terms "the Third and Fourth Dimensions."
@c At last, to complete a series of minor indiscretions, at a meeting of
@c our Local Speculative Society held at the palace of the Prefect himself,
@c --some extremely silly person having read an elaborate paper exhibiting
@c the precise reasons why Providence has limited the number of Dimensions
@c to Two, and why the attribute of omnividence is assigned to the Supreme
@c alone--I so far forgot myself as to give an exact account of the whole
@c of my voyage with the Sphere into Space, and to the Assembly Hall
@c in our Metropolis, and then to Space again, and of my return home,
@c and of everything that I had seen and heard in fact or vision.
@c At first, indeed, I pretended that I was describing the imaginary
@c experiences of a fictitious person; but my enthusiasm soon forced me
@c to throw off all disguise, and finally, in a fervent peroration,
@c I exhorted all my hearers to divest themselves of prejudice
@c and to become believers in the Third Dimension.
@c 
@c Need I say that I was at once arrested and taken before the Council?
@c 
@c Next morning, standing in the very place where but a very few months ago
@c the Sphere had stood in my company, I was allowed to begin and to continue
@c my narration unquestioned and uninterrupted.  But from the first I foresaw
@c my fate; for the President, noting that a guard of the better sort
@c of Policemen was in attendance, of angularity little, if at all,
@c under 55 degrees, ordered them to be relieved before I began my defence,
@c by an inferior class of 2 or 3 degrees.  I knew only too well what that meant.
@c I was to be executed or imprisoned, and my story was to be kept secret
@c from the world by the simultaneous destruction of the officials
@c who had heard it; and, this being the case, the President desired
@c to substitute the cheaper for the more expensive victims.
@c 
@c After I had concluded my defence, the President, perhapsperceiving
@c that some of the junior Circles had been moved by evident earnestness,
@c asked me two questions:--
@c 
@c 1.  Whether I could indicate the direction which I meant when I used
@c the words "Upward, not Northward"?
@c 
@c 2.  Whether I could by any diagrams or descriptions (other than
@c the enumeration of imaginary sides and angles) indicate the Figure
@c I was pleased to call a Cube?
@c 
@c I declared that I could say nothing more, and that I must commit
@c myself to the Truth, whose cause would surely prevail in the end.
@c 
@c The President replied that he quite concurred in my sentiment,
@c and that I could not do better.  I must be sentenced to perpetual
@c imprisonment; but if the Truth intended that I should emerge from
@c prison and evangelize the world, the Truth might be trusted to bring
@c that result to pass.  Meanwhile I should be subjected to no discomfort
@c that was not necessary to preclude escape, and, unless I forfeited the
@c privilege by misconduct, I should be occasionally permitted to see my
@c brother who had preceded me to my prison.
@c 
@c Seven years have elapsed and I am still a prisoner, and--if I
@c except the occasional visits of my brother--debarred from all
@c companionship save that of my jailers.  My brother is one of the best
@c of Squares, just sensible, cheerful, and not without fraternal
@c affection; yet I confess that my weekly interviews, at least
@c in one respect, cause me the bitterest pain.  He was present when
@c the Sphere manifested himself in the Council Chamber; he saw the Sphere's
@c changing sections; he heard the explanation of the phenomena then give
@c to the Circles.  Since that time, scarcely a week has passed during
@c seven whole years, without his hearing from me a repetition of the part
@c I played in that manifestation, together with ample descriptions of all
@c the phenomena in Spaceland, and the arguments for the existence of Solid
@c things derivable from Analogy.  Yet--I take shame to be forced to confess it--
@c my brother has not yet grasped the nature of Three Dimensions, and frankly
@c avows his disbelief in the existence of a Sphere.
@c 
@c Hence I am absolutely destitute of converts, and, for aught that
@c I can see, the millennial Revelation has been made to me for nothing. 
@c Prometheus up in Spaceland was bound for bringing down fire
@c for mortals, but I--poor Flatland Prometheus--lie here in prison
@c for bringing down nothing to my countrymen.  Yet I existing the hope
@c that these memoirs, in some manner, I know not how, may find their way
@c to the minds of humanity in Some Dimension, and may stir up a race
@c of rebels who shall refuse to be confined to limited Dimensionality.
@c 
@c That is the hope of my brighter moments.  Alas, it is not always so.
@c Heavily weights on me at times the burdensome reflection that I cannot
@c honestly say I am confident as to the exact shape of the once-seen,
@c oft-regretted Cube; and in my nightly visions the mysterious precept,
@c "Upward, not Northward," haunts me like a soul-devouring Sphinx.
@c It is part of the martyrdom which I endure for the cause of Truth
@c that there are seasons of mental weakness, when Cubes and Spheres
@c flit away into the background of scarce-possible existences;
@c when the Land of Three Dimensions seems almost as visionary
@c as the Land of One or None; nay, when even this hard wall that bars
@c me from my freedom, these very tablets on which I am writing,
@c and all the substantial realities of Flatland itself,
@c appear no better than the offspring of a diseased imagination,
@c or the baseless fabric of a dream.

@c PREFACE TO THE
@c SECOND AND REVISED
@c EDITION, 1884.
@c BY THE EDITOR
@c 
@c 
@c If my poor Flatland friend retained the vigour of mind which he enjoyed
@c when he began to compose these Memoirs, I should not now need to represent
@c him in this preface, in which he desires, fully, to return his thanks
@c to his readers and critics in Spaceland, whose appreciation has,
@c with unexpected celerity, required a second edition of this work;
@c secondly, to apologize for certain errors and misprints (for which,
@c however, he is not entirely responsible); and, thirdly, to explain
@c on or two misconceptions.  But he is not the Square he once was.
@c Years of imprisonment, and the still heavier burden of general
@c incredulity and mockery, have combined with the thoughts and notions,
@c and much also of the terminology, which he acquired during his
@c short stay in spaceland.  He has, therefore, requested me to reply
@c in his behalf to two special objections, one of an intellectual,
@c the other of a moral nature.
@c 
@c The first objection is, that a Flatlander, seeing a Line,
@c sees something that must be THICK to the eye as well as LONG
@c to the eye (otherwise it would not be visible, if it had not
@c some thickness); and consequently he ought (it is argued)
@c to acknowledge that his countrymen are not only long and broad,
@c but also (though doubtless to a very slight degree) THICK or HIGH.
@c This objection is plausible, and, to Spacelanders, almost irresistible,
@c so that, I confess, when I first heard it, I knew not what to reply.
@c But my poor old friend's answer appears to me completely to meet it.
@c 
@c "I admit," said he--when I mentioned to him this objection--
@c "I admit the truth of your critic's facts, but I deny his conclusions. 
@c It is true that we have really in Flatland a Third unrecognized Dimension
@c called `height,' just as it also is true that you have really in Spaceland
@c a Fourth unrecognized Dimension, called by no name at present, but which
@c I will call `extra-height.'  But we can no more take cognizance of our
@c `height' than you can of your `extra-height.'  Even I--who have been in
@c Spaceland, and have had the privilege of understanding for twenty-four hours
@c the meaning of `height'--even I cannot now comprehend it, nor realize it
@c by the sense of sight or by any process of reason; I can but apprehend
@c it by faith.
@c 
@c "The reason is obvious.  Dimension implied direction, implies
@c measurement, implies the more and the less.  Now, all our lines
@c are EQUALLY and INFINITESIMALLY thick (or high, whichever you like);
@c consequently, there is nothing in them to lead our minds to the
@c conception of that Dimension.  No `delicate micrometer'--as has been
@c suggested by one too hasty Spaceland critic--would in the least
@c avail us; for we should not know WHAT TO MEASURE, NOR IN WHAT DIRECTION.
@c When we see a Line, we see something that is long and BRIGHT;
@c BRIGHTNESS, as well as length, is necessary to the existence of a Line;
@c if the brightness vanishes, the Line is extinguished.  Hence, all my
@c Flatland friends--when I talk to them about the unrecognized Dimension
@c which is somehow visible in a Line--say, `Ah, you mean BRIGHTNESS':
@c and when I reply, `No, I mean a real Dimension,' they at once retort,
@c `Then measure it, or tell us in what direction it extends'; and this
@c silences me, for I can do neither.  Only yesterday, when the Chief Circle
@c (in other words our High Priest) came to inspect the State Prison
@c and paid me his seventh annual visit, and when for the seventh time
@c he put me the question, `Was I any better?'  I tried to prove to him
@c that he was `high,' as well as long and broad, although he did not know it.
@c But what was his reply?  `You say I am "high"; measure my "high-ness"
@c and I will believe you.'  What could I do?  How could I meet his challenge?
@c I was crushed; and he left the room triumphant.
@c 
@c "Does this still seem strange to you?  Then put yourself
@c in asimilar position.  Suppose a person of the Fourth Dimension,
@c condescending to visit you, were to say, `Whenever you open your eyes,
@c you see a Plane (which is of Two Dimensions) and you INFER a Solid
@c (which is of Three); but in reality you also see (though you do
@c not recognize) a Fourth Dimension, which is not colour nor brightness
@c nor anything of the kind, but a true Dimension, although I cannot
@c point out to you its direction, nor can you possibly measure it.'
@c What would you say to such a visitor?  Would not you have him locked up?
@c Well, that is my fate:  and it is as natural for us Flatlanders
@c to lock up a Square for preaching the Third Dimension,
@c as it is for you Spacelanders to lock up a Cube for preaching the Fourth.
@c Alas, how strong a family likeness runs through blind and persecuting
@c humanity in all Dimensions!  Points, Lines, Squares, Cubes, Extra-Cubes--
@c we are all liable to the same errors, all alike the Slavers of our
@c respective Dimensional prejudices, as one of our Spaceland poets has said--
@c 
@c 
@c      `One touch of Nature makes all worlds akin.'" (footnote 1)
@c 
@c 
@c On this point the defence of the Square seems to me to be impregnable.
@c I wish I could say that his answer to the second (or moral) objection
@c was equally clear and cogent.  It has been objected that he is a woman-hater;
@c and as this objection has been vehemently urged by those whom Nature's
@c decree has constituted the somewhat larger half of the Spaceland race,
@c I should like to remove it, so far as I can honestly do so.  But the
@c Square is so unaccustomed to the use of the moral terminology
@c of Spaceland that I should be doing him an injustice if I were
@c literally to transcribe his defence against this charge.
@c Acting, therefore, as his interpreter and summarizer,
@c I gather that in the course of an imprisonment of seven years
@c he has himself modified his own personal views, both as regards
@c Women and as regards the Isosceles or Lower Classes.  Personally,
@c he now inclines to the opinion of the Sphere (see page 86) that
@c the Straight Lines are in many important respects superior to the Circles.
@c But, writing as a Historian, he has identified himself (perhaps too closely)
@c with the views generally adopted by Flatland, and (as he has been informed)
@c even by Spaceland, Historians; in whose pages (until very recent times)
@c the destinies of Women and of the masses of mankind have seldom been deemed
@c worthy of mention and never of careful consideration.
@c 
@c In a still more obscure passage he now desires to disavow
@c the Circular or aristocratic tendencies with which some critics
@c have naturally credited him.  While doing justice to the intellectual
@c power with which a few Circles have for many generations maintained
@c their supremacy over immense multitudes of their countrymen, he believes
@c that the facts of Flatland, speaking for themselves without comment
@c on his part, declare that Revolutions cannot always be suppressed
@c by slaughter, and that Nature, in sentencing the Circles to infecundity,
@c has condemned them to ultimate failure--"and herein," he says,
@c "I see a fulfilment of the great Law of all worlds, that while the wisdom
@c of Man thinks it is working one thing, the wisdom of Nature constrains
@c it to work another, and quite a different and far better thing."
@c For the rest, he begs his readers not to suppose that every minute detail
@c in the daily life of Flatland must needs correspond to some other detail
@c in Spaceland; and yet he hopes that, taken as a whole, his work may prove
@c suggestive as well as amusing, to those Spacelanders of moderate and modest
@c minds who--speaking of that which is of the highest importance, but lies
@c beyond experience--decline to say on the one hand, "This can never be,"
@c and on the other hand, "It must needs be precisely thus,
@c and we know all about it." 
@c 
@c 
@c Footnote 1.  The Author desires me to add, that the misconceptions of
@c some of his critics on this matter has induced him to insert (on pp.
@c 74 and 92) in his dialogue with the Sphere, certain remarks which have
@c a bearing on the point in question and which he had previously omitted
@c as being tedious and unnecessary.
