% SCENE I. Dunsinane. Ante-room in the castle.

%      Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman

% Doctor

%      I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive
%      no truth in your report. When was it she last walked?

% Gentlewoman

%      Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen
%      her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon
%      her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it,
%      write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again
%      return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.

% Doctor

%      A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once
%      the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of
%      watching! In this slumbery agitation, besides her
%      walking and other actual performances, what, at any
%      time, have you heard her say?

% Gentlewoman

%      That, sir, which I will not report after her.

% Doctor

%      You may to me: and 'tis most meet you should.

% Gentlewoman

%      Neither to you nor any one; having no witness to
%      confirm my speech.

%      Enter LADY MACBETH, with a taper

%      Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise;
%      and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.

% Doctor

%      How came she by that light?

% Gentlewoman

%      Why, it stood by her: she has light by her
%      continually; 'tis her command.

% Doctor

%      You see, her eyes are open.

% Gentlewoman

%      Ay, but their sense is shut.

% Doctor

%      What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her hands.

% Gentlewoman

%      It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus
%      washing her hands: I have known her continue in
%      this a quarter of an hour.

% LADY MACBETH

%      Yet here's a spot.

% Doctor

%      Hark! she speaks: I will set down what comes from
%      her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.

% LADY MACBETH

%      Out, damned spot! out, I say!--One: two: why,
%      then, 'tis time to do't.--Hell is murky!--Fie, my
%      lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we
%      fear who knows it, when none can call our power to
%      account?--Yet who would have thought the old man
%      to have had so much blood in him.

% Doctor

%      Do you mark that?

% LADY MACBETH

%      The thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?--
%      What, will these hands ne'er be clean?--No more o'
%      that, my lord, no more o' that: you mar all with
%      this starting.

% Doctor

%      Go to, go to; you have known what you should not.

% Gentlewoman

%      She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of
%      that: heaven knows what she has known.

% LADY MACBETH

%      Here's the smell of the blood still: all the
%      perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little
%      hand. Oh, oh, oh!

% Doctor

%      What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.

% Gentlewoman

%      I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the
%      dignity of the whole body.

% Doctor

%      Well, well, well,--

% Gentlewoman

%      Pray God it be, sir.

% Doctor

%      This disease is beyond my practise: yet I have known
%      those which have walked in their sleep who have died
%      holily in their beds.

% LADY MACBETH

%      Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so
%      pale.--I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; he
%      cannot come out on's grave.

% Doctor

%      Even so?

% LADY MACBETH

%      To bed, to bed! there's knocking at the gate:
%      come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What's
%      done cannot be undone.--To bed, to bed, to bed!

%      Exit

% Doctor

%      Will she go now to bed?

% Gentlewoman

%      Directly.

% Doctor

%      Foul whisperings are abroad: unnatural deeds
%      Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds
%      To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets:
%      More needs she the divine than the physician.
%      God, God forgive us all! Look after her;
%      Remove from her the means of all annoyance,
%      And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night:
%      My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight.
%      I think, but dare not speak.

% Gentlewoman

%      Good night, good doctor.

%      Exeunt

% SCENE II. The country near Dunsinane.

%      Drum and colours. Enter MENTEITH, CAITHNESS, ANGUS, LENNOX, and
%      Soldiers

% MENTEITH

%      The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,
%      His uncle Siward and the good Macduff:
%      Revenges burn in them; for their dear causes
%      Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm
%      Excite the mortified man.

% ANGUS

%      Near Birnam wood
%      Shall we well meet them; that way are they coming.

% CAITHNESS

%      Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?

% LENNOX

%      For certain, sir, he is not: I have a file
%      Of all the gentry: there is Siward's son,
%      And many unrough youths that even now
%      Protest their first of manhood.

% MENTEITH

%      What does the tyrant?

% CAITHNESS

%      Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies:
%      Some say he's mad; others that lesser hate him
%      Do call it valiant fury: but, for certain,
%      He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause
%      Within the belt of rule.

% ANGUS

%      Now does he feel
%      His secret murders sticking on his hands;
%      Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;
%      Those he commands move only in command,
%      Nothing in love: now does he feel his title
%      Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe
%      Upon a dwarfish thief.

% MENTEITH

%      Who then shall blame
%      His pester'd senses to recoil and start,
%      When all that is within him does condemn
%      Itself for being there?

% CAITHNESS

%      Well, march we on,
%      To give obedience where 'tis truly owed:
%      Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal,
%      And with him pour we in our country's purge
%      Each drop of us.

% LENNOX

%      Or so much as it needs,
%      To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.
%      Make we our march towards Birnam.

%      Exeunt, marching

% SCENE III. Dunsinane. A room in the castle.

%      Enter MACBETH, Doctor, and Attendants

% MACBETH

%      Bring me no more reports; let them fly all:
%      Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane,
%      I cannot taint with fear. What's the boy Malcolm?
%      Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know
%      All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus:
%      'Fear not, Macbeth; no man that's born of woman
%      Shall e'er have power upon thee.' Then fly,
%      false thanes,
%      And mingle with the English epicures:
%      The mind I sway by and the heart I bear
%      Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.

%      Enter a Servant

%      The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!
%      Where got'st thou that goose look?

% Servant

%      There is ten thousand--

% MACBETH

%      Geese, villain!

% Servant

%      Soldiers, sir.

% MACBETH

%      Go prick thy face, and over-red thy fear,
%      Thou lily-liver'd boy. What soldiers, patch?
%      Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine
%      Are counsellors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face?

% Servant

%      The English force, so please you.

% MACBETH

%      Take thy face hence.

%      Exit Servant

%      Seyton!--I am sick at heart,
%      When I behold--Seyton, I say!--This push
%      Will cheer me ever, or disseat me now.
%      I have lived long enough: my way of life
%      Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf;
%      And that which should accompany old age,
%      As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,
%      I must not look to have; but, in their stead,
%      Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath,
%      Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not. Seyton!

%      Enter SEYTON

% SEYTON

%      What is your gracious pleasure?

% MACBETH

%      What news more?

% SEYTON

%      All is confirm'd, my lord, which was reported.

% MACBETH

%      I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack'd.
%      Give me my armour.

% SEYTON

%      'Tis not needed yet.

% MACBETH

%      I'll put it on.
%      Send out more horses; skirr the country round;
%      Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armour.
%      How does your patient, doctor?

% Doctor

%      Not so sick, my lord,
%      As she is troubled with thick coming fancies,
%      That keep her from her rest.

% MACBETH

%      Cure her of that.
%      Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased,
%      Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,
%      Raze out the written troubles of the brain
%      And with some sweet oblivious antidote
%      Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff
%      Which weighs upon the heart?

% Doctor

%      Therein the patient
%      Must minister to himself.

% MACBETH

%      Throw physic to the dogs; I'll none of it.
%      Come, put mine armour on; give me my staff.
%      Seyton, send out. Doctor, the thanes fly from me.
%      Come, sir, dispatch. If thou couldst, doctor, cast
%      The water of my land, find her disease,
%      And purge it to a sound and pristine health,
%      I would applaud thee to the very echo,
%      That should applaud again.--Pull't off, I say.--
%      What rhubarb, cyme, or what purgative drug,
%      Would scour these English hence? Hear'st thou of them?

% Doctor

%      Ay, my good lord; your royal preparation
%      Makes us hear something.

% MACBETH

%      Bring it after me.
%      I will not be afraid of death and bane,
%      Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.

% Doctor

%      [Aside] Were I from Dunsinane away and clear,
%      Profit again should hardly draw me here.

%      Exeunt

% SCENE IV. Country near Birnam wood.

%      Drum and colours. Enter MALCOLM, SIWARD and YOUNG SIWARD, MACDUFF,
%      MENTEITH, CAITHNESS, ANGUS, LENNOX, ROSS, and Soldiers, marching

% MALCOLM

%      Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand
%      That chambers will be safe.

% MENTEITH

%      We doubt it nothing.

% SIWARD

%      What wood is this before us?

% MENTEITH

%      The wood of Birnam.

% MALCOLM

%      Let every soldier hew him down a bough
%      And bear't before him: thereby shall we shadow
%      The numbers of our host and make discovery
%      Err in report of us.

% Soldiers

%      It shall be done.

% SIWARD

%      We learn no other but the confident tyrant
%      Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure
%      Our setting down before 't.

% MALCOLM

%      'Tis his main hope:
%      For where there is advantage to be given,
%      Both more and less have given him the revolt,
%      And none serve with him but constrained things
%      Whose hearts are absent too.

% MACDUFF

%      Let our just censures
%      Attend the true event, and put we on
%      Industrious soldiership.

% SIWARD

%      The time approaches
%      That will with due decision make us know
%      What we shall say we have and what we owe.
%      Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate,
%      But certain issue strokes must arbitrate:
%      Towards which advance the war.

%      Exeunt, marching

% SCENE V. Dunsinane. Within the castle.

%      Enter MACBETH, SEYTON, and Soldiers, with drum and colours

% MACBETH

%      Hang out our banners on the outward walls;
%      The cry is still 'They come:' our castle's strength
%      Will laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lie
%      Till famine and the ague eat them up:
%      Were they not forced with those that should be ours,
%      We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,
%      And beat them backward home.

%      A cry of women within

%      What is that noise?

% SEYTON

%      It is the cry of women, my good lord.

%      Exit

% MACBETH

%      I have almost forgot the taste of fears;
%      The time has been, my senses would have cool'd
%      To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair
%      Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
%      As life were in't: I have supp'd full with horrors;
%      Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts
%      Cannot once start me.

%      Re-enter SEYTON

%      Wherefore was that cry?

% SEYTON

%      The queen, my lord, is dead.

% MACBETH

%      She should have died hereafter;
%      There would have been a time for such a word.
%      To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,
%      Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
%      To the last syllable of recorded time,
%      And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
%      The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
%      Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
%      That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
%      And then is heard no more: it is a tale
%      Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
%      Signifying nothing.

%      Enter a Messenger

%      Thou comest to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.

% Messenger

%      Gracious my lord,
%      I should report that which I say I saw,
%      But know not how to do it.

% MACBETH

%      Well, say, sir.

% Messenger

%      As I did stand my watch upon the hill,
%      I look'd toward Birnam, and anon, methought,
%      The wood began to move.

% MACBETH

%      Liar and slave!

% Messenger

%      Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so:
%      Within this three mile may you see it coming;
%      I say, a moving grove.

% MACBETH

%      If thou speak'st false,
%      Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,
%      Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,
%      I care not if thou dost for me as much.
%      I pull in resolution, and begin
%      To doubt the equivocation of the fiend
%      That lies like truth: 'Fear not, till Birnam wood
%      Do come to Dunsinane:' and now a wood
%      Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out!
%      If this which he avouches does appear,
%      There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.
%      I gin to be aweary of the sun,
%      And wish the estate o' the world were now undone.
%      Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
%      At least we'll die with harness on our back.

%      Exeunt

% SCENE VI. Dunsinane. Before the castle.

%      Drum and colours. Enter MALCOLM, SIWARD, MACDUFF, and their Army,
%      with boughs

% MALCOLM

%      Now near enough: your leafy screens throw down.
%      And show like those you are. You, worthy uncle,
%      Shall, with my cousin, your right-noble son,
%      Lead our first battle: worthy Macduff and we
%      Shall take upon 's what else remains to do,
%      According to our order.

% SIWARD

%      Fare you well.
%      Do we but find the tyrant's power to-night,
%      Let us be beaten, if we cannot fight.

% MACDUFF

%      Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,
%      Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.

%      Exeunt

% SCENE VII. Another part of the field.

%      Alarums. Enter MACBETH

% MACBETH

%      They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly,
%      But, bear-like, I must fight the course. What's he
%      That was not born of woman? Such a one
%      Am I to fear, or none.

%      Enter YOUNG SIWARD

% YOUNG SIWARD

%      What is thy name?

% MACBETH

%      Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.

% YOUNG SIWARD

%      No; though thou call'st thyself a hotter name
%      Than any is in hell.

% MACBETH

%      My name's Macbeth.

% YOUNG SIWARD

%      The devil himself could not pronounce a title
%      More hateful to mine ear.

% MACBETH

%      No, nor more fearful.

% YOUNG SIWARD

%      Thou liest, abhorred tyrant; with my sword
%      I'll prove the lie thou speak'st.

%      They fight and YOUNG SIWARD is slain

% MACBETH

%      Thou wast born of woman
%      But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,
%      Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born.

%      Exit

%      Alarums. Enter MACDUFF

% MACDUFF

%      That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face!
%      If thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine,
%      My wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.
%      I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms
%      Are hired to bear their staves: either thou, Macbeth,
%      Or else my sword with an unbatter'd edge
%      I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;
%      By this great clatter, one of greatest note
%      Seems bruited. Let me find him, fortune!
%      And more I beg not.

%      Exit. Alarums

%      Enter MALCOLM and SIWARD

% SIWARD

%      This way, my lord; the castle's gently render'd:
%      The tyrant's people on both sides do fight;
%      The noble thanes do bravely in the war;
%      The day almost itself professes yours,
%      And little is to do.

% MALCOLM

%      We have met with foes
%      That strike beside us.

% SIWARD

%      Enter, sir, the castle.

%      Exeunt. Alarums

% SCENE VIII. Another part of the field.

%      Enter MACBETH

% MACBETH

%      Why should I play the Roman fool, and die
%      On mine own sword? whiles I see lives, the gashes
%      Do better upon them.

%      Enter MACDUFF

% MACDUFF

%      Turn, hell-hound, turn!

% MACBETH

%      Of all men else I have avoided thee:
%      But get thee back; my soul is too much charged
%      With blood of thine already.

% MACDUFF

%      I have no words:
%      My voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villain
%      Than terms can give thee out!

%      They fight

% MACBETH

%      Thou losest labour:
%      As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
%      With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed:
%      Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
%      I bear a charmed life, which must not yield,
%      To one of woman born.

% MACDUFF

%      Despair thy charm;
%      And let the angel whom thou still hast served
%      Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb
%      Untimely ripp'd.

% MACBETH

%      Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,
%      For it hath cow'd my better part of man!
%      And be these juggling fiends no more believed,
%      That palter with us in a double sense;
%      That keep the word of promise to our ear,
%      And break it to our hope. I'll not fight with thee.

% MACDUFF

%      Then yield thee, coward,
%      And live to be the show and gaze o' the time:
%      We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,
%      Painted on a pole, and underwrit,
%      'Here may you see the tyrant.'

% MACBETH

%      I will not yield,
%      To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet,
%      And to be baited with the rabble's curse.
%      Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,
%      And thou opposed, being of no woman born,
%      Yet I will try the last. Before my body
%      I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,
%      And damn'd be him that first cries, 'Hold, enough!'

%      Exeunt, fighting. Alarums

%      Retreat. Flourish. Enter, with drum and colours, MALCOLM, SIWARD,
%      ROSS, the other Thanes, and Soldiers

% MALCOLM

%      I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.

% SIWARD

%      Some must go off: and yet, by these I see,
%      So great a day as this is cheaply bought.

% MALCOLM

%      Macduff is missing, and your noble son.

% ROSS

%      Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt:
%      He only lived but till he was a man;
%      The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd
%      In the unshrinking station where he fought,
%      But like a man he died.

% SIWARD

%      Then he is dead?

% ROSS

%      Ay, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow
%      Must not be measured by his worth, for then
%      It hath no end.

% SIWARD

%      Had he his hurts before?

% ROSS

%      Ay, on the front.

% SIWARD

%      Why then, God's soldier be he!
%      Had I as many sons as I have hairs,
%      I would not wish them to a fairer death:
%      And so, his knell is knoll'd.

% MALCOLM

%      He's worth more sorrow,
%      And that I'll spend for him.

% SIWARD

%      He's worth no more
%      They say he parted well, and paid his score:
%      And so, God be with him! Here comes newer comfort.

%      Re-enter MACDUFF, with MACBETH's head

% MACDUFF

%      Hail, king! for so thou art: behold, where stands
%      The usurper's cursed head: the time is free:
%      I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl,
%      That speak my salutation in their minds;
%      Whose voices I desire aloud with mine:
%      Hail, King of Scotland!

% ALL

%      Hail, King of Scotland!

%      Flourish

% MALCOLM

%      We shall not spend a large expense of time
%      Before we reckon with your several loves,
%      And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen,
%      Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland
%      In such an honour named. What's more to do,
%      Which would be planted newly with the time,
%      As calling home our exiled friends abroad
%      That fled the snares of watchful tyranny;
%      Producing forth the cruel ministers
%      Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,
%      Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands
%      Took off her life; this, and what needful else
%      That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,
%      We will perform in measure, time and place:
%      So, thanks to all at once and to each one,
%      Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone.

%      Flourish. Exeunt
