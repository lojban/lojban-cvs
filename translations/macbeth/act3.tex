% SCENE I. Forres. The palace.

%      Enter BANQUO

% BANQUO

%      Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all,
%      As the weird women promised, and, I fear,
%      Thou play'dst most foully for't: yet it was said
%      It should not stand in thy posterity,
%      But that myself should be the root and father
%      Of many kings. If there come truth from them--
%      As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine--
%      Why, by the verities on thee made good,
%      May they not be my oracles as well,
%      And set me up in hope? But hush! no more.

%      Sennet sounded. Enter MACBETH, as king, LADY MACBETH, as queen,
%      LENNOX, ROSS, Lords, Ladies, and Attendants

% MACBETH

%      Here's our chief guest.

% LADY MACBETH

%      If he had been forgotten,
%      It had been as a gap in our great feast,
%      And all-thing unbecoming.

% MACBETH

%      To-night we hold a solemn supper sir,
%      And I'll request your presence.

% BANQUO

%      Let your highness
%      Command upon me; to the which my duties
%      Are with a most indissoluble tie
%      For ever knit.

% MACBETH

%      Ride you this afternoon?

% BANQUO

%      Ay, my good lord.

% MACBETH

%      We should have else desired your good advice,
%      Which still hath been both grave and prosperous,
%      In this day's council; but we'll take to-morrow.
%      Is't far you ride?

% BANQUO

%      As far, my lord, as will fill up the time
%      'Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better,
%      I must become a borrower of the night
%      For a dark hour or twain.

% MACBETH

%      Fail not our feast.

% BANQUO

%      My lord, I will not.

% MACBETH

%      We hear, our bloody cousins are bestow'd
%      In England and in Ireland, not confessing
%      Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers
%      With strange invention: but of that to-morrow,
%      When therewithal we shall have cause of state
%      Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse: adieu,
%      Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?

% BANQUO

%      Ay, my good lord: our time does call upon 's.

% MACBETH

%      I wish your horses swift and sure of foot;
%      And so I do commend you to their backs. Farewell.

%      Exit BANQUO

%      Let every man be master of his time
%      Till seven at night: to make society
%      The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself
%      Till supper-time alone: while then, God be with you!

%      Exeunt all but MACBETH, and an attendant

%      Sirrah, a word with you: attend those men
%      Our pleasure?

% ATTENDANT

%      They are, my lord, without the palace gate.

% MACBETH

%      Bring them before us.

%      Exit Attendant

%      To be thus is nothing;
%      But to be safely thus.--Our fears in Banquo
%      Stick deep; and in his royalty of nature
%      Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;
%      And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,
%      He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour
%      To act in safety. There is none but he
%      Whose being I do fear: and, under him,
%      My Genius is rebuked; as, it is said,
%      Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters
%      When first they put the name of king upon me,
%      And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like
%      They hail'd him father to a line of kings:
%      Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,
%      And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,
%      Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,
%      No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so,
%      For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind;
%      For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd;
%      Put rancours in the vessel of my peace
%      Only for them; and mine eternal jewel
%      Given to the common enemy of man,
%      To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!
%      Rather than so, come fate into the list.
%      And champion me to the utterance! Who's there!

%      Re-enter Attendant, with two Murderers

%      Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.

%      Exit Attendant

%      Was it not yesterday we spoke together?

% First Murderer

%      It was, so please your highness.

% MACBETH

%      Well then, now
%      Have you consider'd of my speeches? Know
%      That it was he in the times past which held you
%      So under fortune, which you thought had been
%      Our innocent self: this I made good to you
%      In our last conference, pass'd in probation with you,
%      How you were borne in hand, how cross'd,
%      the instruments,
%      Who wrought with them, and all things else that might
%      To half a soul and to a notion crazed
%      Say 'Thus did Banquo.'

% First Murderer

%      You made it known to us.

% MACBETH

%      I did so, and went further, which is now
%      Our point of second meeting. Do you find
%      Your patience so predominant in your nature
%      That you can let this go? Are you so gospell'd
%      To pray for this good man and for his issue,
%      Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave
%      And beggar'd yours for ever?

% First Murderer

%      We are men, my liege.

% MACBETH

%      Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;
%      As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,
%      Shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves, are clept
%      All by the name of dogs: the valued file
%      Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,
%      The housekeeper, the hunter, every one
%      According to the gift which bounteous nature
%      Hath in him closed; whereby he does receive
%      Particular addition. from the bill
%      That writes them all alike: and so of men.
%      Now, if you have a station in the file,
%      Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say 't;
%      And I will put that business in your bosoms,
%      Whose execution takes your enemy off,
%      Grapples you to the heart and love of us,
%      Who wear our health but sickly in his life,
%      Which in his death were perfect.

% Second Murderer

%      I am one, my liege,
%      Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world
%      Have so incensed that I am reckless what
%      I do to spite the world.

% First Murderer

%      And I another
%      So weary with disasters, tugg'd with fortune,
%      That I would set my lie on any chance,
%      To mend it, or be rid on't.

% MACBETH

%      Both of you
%      Know Banquo was your enemy.

% Both Murderers

%      True, my lord.

% MACBETH

%      So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,
%      That every minute of his being thrusts
%      Against my near'st of life: and though I could
%      With barefaced power sweep him from my sight
%      And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,
%      For certain friends that are both his and mine,
%      Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall
%      Who I myself struck down; and thence it is,
%      That I to your assistance do make love,
%      Masking the business from the common eye
%      For sundry weighty reasons.

% Second Murderer

%      We shall, my lord,
%      Perform what you command us.

% First Murderer

%      Though our lives--

% MACBETH

%      Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most
%      I will advise you where to plant yourselves;
%      Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time,
%      The moment on't; for't must be done to-night,
%      And something from the palace; always thought
%      That I require a clearness: and with him--
%      To leave no rubs nor botches in the work--
%      Fleance his son, that keeps him company,
%      Whose absence is no less material to me
%      Than is his father's, must embrace the fate
%      Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart:
%      I'll come to you anon.

% Both Murderers

%      We are resolved, my lord.

% MACBETH

%      I'll call upon you straight: abide within.

%      Exeunt Murderers

%      It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul's flight,
%      If it find heaven, must find it out to-night.

%      Exit

% SCENE II. The palace.

%      Enter LADY MACBETH and a Servant

% LADY MACBETH

%      Is Banquo gone from court?

% Servant

%      Ay, madam, but returns again to-night.

% LADY MACBETH

%      Say to the king, I would attend his leisure
%      For a few words.

% Servant

%      Madam, I will.

%      Exit

% LADY MACBETH

%      Nought's had, all's spent,
%      Where our desire is got without content:
%      'Tis safer to be that which we destroy
%      Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.

%      Enter MACBETH

%      How now, my lord! why do you keep alone,
%      Of sorriest fancies your companions making,
%      Using those thoughts which should indeed have died
%      With them they think on? Things without all remedy
%      Should be without regard: what's done is done.

% MACBETH

%      We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it:
%      She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice
%      Remains in danger of her former tooth.
%      But let the frame of things disjoint, both the
%      worlds suffer,
%      Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep
%      In the affliction of these terrible dreams
%      That shake us nightly: better be with the dead,
%      Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,
%      Than on the torture of the mind to lie
%      In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;
%      After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;
%      Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,
%      Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,
%      Can touch him further.

% LADY MACBETH

%      Come on;
%      Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks;
%      Be bright and jovial among your guests to-night.

% MACBETH

%      So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you:
%      Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;
%      Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue:
%      Unsafe the while, that we
%      Must lave our honours in these flattering streams,
%      And make our faces vizards to our hearts,
%      Disguising what they are.

% LADY MACBETH

%      You must leave this.

% MACBETH

%      O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!
%      Thou know'st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.

% LADY MACBETH

%      But in them nature's copy's not eterne.

% MACBETH

%      There's comfort yet; they are assailable;
%      Then be thou jocund: ere the bat hath flown
%      His cloister'd flight, ere to black Hecate's summons
%      The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums
%      Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done
%      A deed of dreadful note.

% LADY MACBETH

%      What's to be done?

% MACBETH

%      Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,
%      Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,
%      Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day;
%      And with thy bloody and invisible hand
%      Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
%      Which keeps me pale! Light thickens; and the crow
%      Makes wing to the rooky wood:
%      Good things of day begin to droop and drowse;
%      While night's black agents to their preys do rouse.
%      Thou marvell'st at my words: but hold thee still;
%      Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.
%      So, prithee, go with me.

%      Exeunt

% SCENE III. A park near the palace.

%      Enter three Murderers

% First Murderer

%      But who did bid thee join with us?

% Third Murderer

%      Macbeth.

% Second Murderer

%      He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers
%      Our offices and what we have to do
%      To the direction just.

% First Murderer

%      Then stand with us.
%      The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day:
%      Now spurs the lated traveller apace
%      To gain the timely inn; and near approaches
%      The subject of our watch.

% Third Murderer

%      Hark! I hear horses.

% BANQUO

%      [Within] Give us a light there, ho!

% Second Murderer

%      Then 'tis he: the rest
%      That are within the note of expectation
%      Already are i' the court.

% First Murderer

%      His horses go about.

% Third Murderer

%      Almost a mile: but he does usually,
%      So all men do, from hence to the palace gate
%      Make it their walk.

% Second Murderer

%      A light, a light!

%      Enter BANQUO, and FLEANCE with a torch

% Third Murderer

%      'Tis he.

% First Murderer

%      Stand to't.

% BANQUO

%      It will be rain to-night.

% First Murderer

%      Let it come down.

%      They set upon BANQUO

% BANQUO

%      O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!
%      Thou mayst revenge. O slave!

%      Dies. FLEANCE escapes

% Third Murderer

%      Who did strike out the light?

% First Murderer

%      Wast not the way?

% Third Murderer

%      There's but one down; the son is fled.

% Second Murderer

%      We have lost
%      Best half of our affair.

% First Murderer

%      Well, let's away, and say how much is done.

%      Exeunt

% SCENE IV. The same. Hall in the palace.

%      A banquet prepared. Enter MACBETH, LADY MACBETH, ROSS, LENNOX,
%      Lords, and Attendants

% MACBETH

%      You know your own degrees; sit down: at first
%      And last the hearty welcome.

% Lords

%      Thanks to your majesty.

% MACBETH

%      Ourself will mingle with society,
%      And play the humble host.
%      Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time
%      We will require her welcome.

% LADY MACBETH

%      Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends;
%      For my heart speaks they are welcome.

%      First Murderer appears at the door

% MACBETH

%      See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.
%      Both sides are even: here I'll sit i' the midst:
%      Be large in mirth; anon we'll drink a measure
%      The table round.

%      Approaching the door

%      There's blood on thy face.

% First Murderer

%      'Tis Banquo's then.

% MACBETH

%      'Tis better thee without than he within.
%      Is he dispatch'd?

% First Murderer

%      My lord, his throat is cut; that I did for him.

% MACBETH

%      Thou art the best o' the cut-throats: yet he's good
%      That did the like for Fleance: if thou didst it,
%      Thou art the nonpareil.

% First Murderer

%      Most royal sir,
%      Fleance is 'scaped.

% MACBETH

%      Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect,
%      Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,
%      As broad and general as the casing air:
%      But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confined, bound in
%      To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo's safe?

% First Murderer

%      Ay, my good lord: safe in a ditch he bides,
%      With twenty trenched gashes on his head;
%      The least a death to nature.

% MACBETH

%      Thanks for that:
%      There the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fled
%      Hath nature that in time will venom breed,
%      No teeth for the present. Get thee gone: to-morrow
%      We'll hear, ourselves, again.

%      Exit Murderer

% LADY MACBETH

%      My royal lord,
%      You do not give the cheer: the feast is sold
%      That is not often vouch'd, while 'tis a-making,
%      'Tis given with welcome: to feed were best at home;
%      From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;
%      Meeting were bare without it.

% MACBETH

%      Sweet remembrancer!
%      Now, good digestion wait on appetite,
%      And health on both!

% LENNOX

%      May't please your highness sit.

%      The GHOST OF BANQUO enters, and sits in MACBETH's place

% MACBETH

%      Here had we now our country's honour roof'd,
%      Were the graced person of our Banquo present;
%      Who may I rather challenge for unkindness
%      Than pity for mischance!

% ROSS

%      His absence, sir,
%      Lays blame upon his promise. Please't your highness
%      To grace us with your royal company.

% MACBETH

%      The table's full.

% LENNOX

%      Here is a place reserved, sir.

% MACBETH

%      Where?

% LENNOX

%      Here, my good lord. What is't that moves your highness?

% MACBETH

%      Which of you have done this?

% Lords

%      What, my good lord?

% MACBETH

%      Thou canst not say I did it: never shake
%      Thy gory locks at me.

% ROSS

%      Gentlemen, rise: his highness is not well.

% LADY MACBETH

%      Sit, worthy friends: my lord is often thus,
%      And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat;
%      The fit is momentary; upon a thought
%      He will again be well: if much you note him,
%      You shall offend him and extend his passion:
%      Feed, and regard him not. Are you a man?

% MACBETH

%      Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that
%      Which might appal the devil.

% LADY MACBETH

%      O proper stuff!
%      This is the very painting of your fear:
%      This is the air-drawn dagger which, you said,
%      Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,
%      Impostors to true fear, would well become
%      A woman's story at a winter's fire,
%      Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself!
%      Why do you make such faces? When all's done,
%      You look but on a stool.

% MACBETH

%      Prithee, see there! behold! look! lo!
%      how say you?
%      Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.
%      If charnel-houses and our graves must send
%      Those that we bury back, our monuments
%      Shall be the maws of kites.

%      GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes

% LADY MACBETH

%      What, quite unmann'd in folly?

% MACBETH

%      If I stand here, I saw him.

% LADY MACBETH

%      Fie, for shame!

% MACBETH

%      Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time,
%      Ere human statute purged the gentle weal;
%      Ay, and since too, murders have been perform'd
%      Too terrible for the ear: the times have been,
%      That, when the brains were out, the man would die,
%      And there an end; but now they rise again,
%      With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,
%      And push us from our stools: this is more strange
%      Than such a murder is.

% LADY MACBETH

%      My worthy lord,
%      Your noble friends do lack you.

% MACBETH

%      I do forget.
%      Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends,
%      I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing
%      To those that know me. Come, love and health to all;
%      Then I'll sit down. Give me some wine; fill full.
%      I drink to the general joy o' the whole table,
%      And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss;
%      Would he were here! to all, and him, we thirst,
%      And all to all.

% Lords

%      Our duties, and the pledge.

%      Re-enter GHOST OF BANQUO

% MACBETH

%      Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee!
%      Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;
%      Thou hast no speculation in those eyes
%      Which thou dost glare with!

% LADY MACBETH

%      Think of this, good peers,
%      But as a thing of custom: 'tis no other;
%      Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.

% MACBETH

%      What man dare, I dare:
%      Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,
%      The arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger;
%      Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves
%      Shall never tremble: or be alive again,
%      And dare me to the desert with thy sword;
%      If trembling I inhabit then, protest me
%      The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!
%      Unreal mockery, hence!

%      GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes

%      Why, so: being gone,
%      I am a man again. Pray you, sit still.

% LADY MACBETH

%      You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting,
%      With most admired disorder.

% MACBETH

%      Can such things be,
%      And overcome us like a summer's cloud,
%      Without our special wonder? You make me strange
%      Even to the disposition that I owe,
%      When now I think you can behold such sights,
%      And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,
%      When mine is blanched with fear.

% ROSS

%      What sights, my lord?

% LADY MACBETH

%      I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;
%      Question enrages him. At once, good night:
%      Stand not upon the order of your going,
%      But go at once.

% LENNOX

%      Good night; and better health
%      Attend his majesty!

% LADY MACBETH

%      A kind good night to all!

%      Exeunt all but MACBETH and LADY MACBETH

% MACBETH

%      It will have blood; they say, blood will have blood:
%      Stones have been known to move and trees to speak;
%      Augurs and understood relations have
%      By magot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth
%      The secret'st man of blood. What is the night?

% LADY MACBETH

%      Almost at odds with morning, which is which.

% MACBETH

%      How say'st thou, that Macduff denies his person
%      At our great bidding?

% LADY MACBETH

%      Did you send to him, sir?

% MACBETH

%      I hear it by the way; but I will send:
%      There's not a one of them but in his house
%      I keep a servant fee'd. I will to-morrow,
%      And betimes I will, to the weird sisters:
%      More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,
%      By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good,
%      All causes shall give way: I am in blood
%      Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more,
%      Returning were as tedious as go o'er:
%      Strange things I have in head, that will to hand;
%      Which must be acted ere they may be scann'd.

% LADY MACBETH

%      You lack the season of all natures, sleep.

% MACBETH

%      Come, we'll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse
%      Is the initiate fear that wants hard use:
%      We are yet but young in deed.

%      Exeunt

% SCENE V. A Heath.

%      Thunder. Enter the three Witches meeting HECATE

% First Witch

%      Why, how now, Hecate! you look angerly.

% HECATE

%      Have I not reason, beldams as you are,
%      Saucy and overbold? How did you dare
%      To trade and traffic with Macbeth
%      In riddles and affairs of death;
%      And I, the mistress of your charms,
%      The close contriver of all harms,
%      Was never call'd to bear my part,
%      Or show the glory of our art?
%      And, which is worse, all you have done
%      Hath been but for a wayward son,
%      Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do,
%      Loves for his own ends, not for you.
%      But make amends now: get you gone,
%      And at the pit of Acheron
%      Meet me i' the morning: thither he
%      Will come to know his destiny:
%      Your vessels and your spells provide,
%      Your charms and every thing beside.
%      I am for the air; this night I'll spend
%      Unto a dismal and a fatal end:
%      Great business must be wrought ere noon:
%      Upon the corner of the moon
%      There hangs a vaporous drop profound;
%      I'll catch it ere it come to ground:
%      And that distill'd by magic sleights
%      Shall raise such artificial sprites
%      As by the strength of their illusion
%      Shall draw him on to his confusion:
%      He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear
%      He hopes 'bove wisdom, grace and fear:
%      And you all know, security
%      Is mortals' chiefest enemy.

%      Music and a song within: 'Come away, come away,' & c

%      Hark! I am call'd; my little spirit, see,
%      Sits in a foggy cloud, and stays for me.

%      Exit

% First Witch

%      Come, let's make haste; she'll soon be back again.

%      Exeunt

% SCENE VI. Forres. The palace.

%      Enter LENNOX and another Lord

% LENNOX

%      My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,
%      Which can interpret further: only, I say,
%      Things have been strangely borne. The
%      gracious Duncan
%      Was pitied of Macbeth: marry, he was dead:
%      And the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too late;
%      Whom, you may say, if't please you, Fleance kill'd,
%      For Fleance fled: men must not walk too late.
%      Who cannot want the thought how monstrous
%      It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain
%      To kill their gracious father? damned fact!
%      How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight
%      In pious rage the two delinquents tear,
%      That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?
%      Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;
%      For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive
%      To hear the men deny't. So that, I say,
%      He has borne all things well: and I do think
%      That had he Duncan's sons under his key--
%      As, an't please heaven, he shall not--they
%      should find
%      What 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.
%      But, peace! for from broad words and 'cause he fail'd
%      His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear
%      Macduff lives in disgrace: sir, can you tell
%      Where he bestows himself?

% Lord

%      The son of Duncan,
%      From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth
%      Lives in the English court, and is received
%      Of the most pious Edward with such grace
%      That the malevolence of fortune nothing
%      Takes from his high respect: thither Macduff
%      Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid
%      To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward:
%      That, by the help of these--with Him above
%      To ratify the work--we may again
%      Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,
%      Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,
%      Do faithful homage and receive free honours:
%      All which we pine for now: and this report
%      Hath so exasperate the king that he
%      Prepares for some attempt of war.

% LENNOX

%      Sent he to Macduff?

% Lord

%      He did: and with an absolute 'Sir, not I,'
%      The cloudy messenger turns me his back,
%      And hums, as who should say 'You'll rue the time
%      That clogs me with this answer.'

% LENNOX

%      And that well might
%      Advise him to a caution, to hold what distance
%      His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel
%      Fly to the court of England and unfold
%      His message ere he come, that a swift blessing
%      May soon return to this our suffering country
%      Under a hand accursed!

% Lord

%      I'll send my prayers with him.

%      Exeunt
