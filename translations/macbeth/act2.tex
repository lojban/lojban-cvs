% SCENE I. Court of Macbeth's castle.

%      Enter BANQUO, and FLEANCE bearing a torch before him

% BANQUO

%      How goes the night, boy?

% FLEANCE

%      The moon is down; I have not heard the clock.

% BANQUO

%      And she goes down at twelve.

% FLEANCE

%      I take't, 'tis later, sir.

% BANQUO

%      Hold, take my sword. There's husbandry in heaven;
%      Their candles are all out. Take thee that too.
%      A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,
%      And yet I would not sleep: merciful powers,
%      Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature
%      Gives way to in repose!

%      Enter MACBETH, and a Servant with a torch

%      Give me my sword.
%      Who's there?

% MACBETH

%      A friend.

% BANQUO

%      What, sir, not yet at rest? The king's a-bed:
%      He hath been in unusual pleasure, and
%      Sent forth great largess to your offices.
%      This diamond he greets your wife withal,
%      By the name of most kind hostess; and shut up
%      In measureless content.

% MACBETH

%      Being unprepared,
%      Our will became the servant to defect;
%      Which else should free have wrought.

% BANQUO

%      All's well.
%      I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:
%      To you they have show'd some truth.

% MACBETH

%      I think not of them:
%      Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,
%      We would spend it in some words upon that business,
%      If you would grant the time.

% BANQUO

%      At your kind'st leisure.

% MACBETH

%      If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,
%      It shall make honour for you.

% BANQUO

%      So I lose none
%      In seeking to augment it, but still keep
%      My bosom franchised and allegiance clear,
%      I shall be counsell'd.

% MACBETH

%      Good repose the while!

% BANQUO

%      Thanks, sir: the like to you!

%      Exeunt BANQUO and FLEANCE

% MACBETH

%      Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,
%      She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.

%      Exit Servant

%      Is this a dagger which I see before me,
%      The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.
%      I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
%      Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible
%      To feeling as to sight? or art thou but
%      A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
%      Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
%      I see thee yet, in form as palpable
%      As this which now I draw.
%      Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going;
%      And such an instrument I was to use.
%      Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,
%      Or else worth all the rest; I see thee still,
%      And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,
%      Which was not so before. There's no such thing:
%      It is the bloody business which informs
%      Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one halfworld
%      Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse
%      The curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates
%      Pale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder,
%      Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,
%      Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace.
%      With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design
%      Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,
%      Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear
%      Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,
%      And take the present horror from the time,
%      Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives:
%      Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.

%      A bell rings

%      I go, and it is done; the bell invites me.
%      Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell
%      That summons thee to heaven or to hell.

%      Exit

% SCENE II. The same.

%      Enter LADY MACBETH

% LADY MACBETH

%      That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold;
%      What hath quench'd them hath given me fire.
%      Hark! Peace!
%      It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,
%      Which gives the stern'st good-night. He is about it:
%      The doors are open; and the surfeited grooms
%      Do mock their charge with snores: I have drugg'd
%      their possets,
%      That death and nature do contend about them,
%      Whether they live or die.

% MACBETH

%      [Within] Who's there? what, ho!

% LADY MACBETH

%      Alack, I am afraid they have awaked,
%      And 'tis not done. The attempt and not the deed
%      Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready;
%      He could not miss 'em. Had he not resembled
%      My father as he slept, I had done't.

%      Enter MACBETH

%      My husband!

% MACBETH

%      I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?

% LADY MACBETH

%      I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
%      Did not you speak?

% MACBETH

%      When?

% LADY MACBETH

%      Now.

% MACBETH

%      As I descended?

% LADY MACBETH

%      Ay.

% MACBETH

%      Hark!
%      Who lies i' the second chamber?

% LADY MACBETH

%      Donalbain.

% MACBETH

%      This is a sorry sight.

%      Looking on his hands

% LADY MACBETH

%      A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.

% MACBETH

%      There's one did laugh in's sleep, and one cried
%      'Murder!'
%      That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them:
%      But they did say their prayers, and address'd them
%      Again to sleep.

% LADY MACBETH

%      There are two lodged together.

% MACBETH

%      One cried 'God bless us!' and 'Amen' the other;
%      As they had seen me with these hangman's hands.
%      Listening their fear, I could not say 'Amen,'
%      When they did say 'God bless us!'

% LADY MACBETH

%      Consider it not so deeply.

% MACBETH

%      But wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen'?
%      I had most need of blessing, and 'Amen'
%      Stuck in my throat.

% LADY MACBETH

%      These deeds must not be thought
%      After these ways; so, it will make us mad.

% MACBETH

%      Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more!
%      Macbeth does murder sleep', the innocent sleep,
%      Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care,
%      The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath,
%      Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,
%      Chief nourisher in life's feast,--

% LADY MACBETH

%      What do you mean?

% MACBETH

%      Still it cried 'Sleep no more!' to all the house:
%      'Glamis hath murder'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor
%      Shall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no more.'

% LADY MACBETH

%      Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,
%      You do unbend your noble strength, to think
%      So brainsickly of things. Go get some water,
%      And wash this filthy witness from your hand.
%      Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
%      They must lie there: go carry them; and smear
%      The sleepy grooms with blood.

% MACBETH

%      I'll go no more:
%      I am afraid to think what I have done;
%      Look on't again I dare not.

% LADY MACBETH

%      Infirm of purpose!
%      Give me the daggers: the sleeping and the dead
%      Are but as pictures: 'tis the eye of childhood
%      That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,
%      I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal;
%      For it must seem their guilt.

%      Exit. Knocking within

% MACBETH

%      Whence is that knocking?
%      How is't with me, when every noise appals me?
%      What hands are here? ha! they pluck out mine eyes.
%      Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood
%      Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather
%      The multitudinous seas in incarnadine,
%      Making the green one red.

%      Re-enter LADY MACBETH

% LADY MACBETH

%      My hands are of your colour; but I shame
%      To wear a heart so white.

%      Knocking within

%      I hear a knocking
%      At the south entry: retire we to our chamber;
%      A little water clears us of this deed:
%      How easy is it, then! Your constancy
%      Hath left you unattended.

%      Knocking within

%      Hark! more knocking.
%      Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us,
%      And show us to be watchers. Be not lost
%      So poorly in your thoughts.

% MACBETH

%      To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself.

%      Knocking within

%      Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst!

%      Exeunt

% SCENE III. The same.

%      Knocking within. Enter a Porter

% Porter

%      Here's a knocking indeed! If a
%      man were porter of hell-gate, he should have
%      old turning the key.

%      Knocking within

%      Knock,
%      knock, knock! Who's there, i' the name of
%      Beelzebub? Here's a farmer, that hanged
%      himself on the expectation of plenty: come in
%      time; have napkins enow about you; here
%      you'll sweat for't.

%      Knocking within

%      Knock,
%      knock! Who's there, in the other devil's
%      name? Faith, here's an equivocator, that could
%      swear in both the scales against either scale;
%      who committed treason enough for God's sake,
%      yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come
%      in, equivocator.

%      Knocking within

%      Knock,
%      knock, knock! Who's there? Faith, here's an
%      English tailor come hither, for stealing out of
%      a French hose: come in, tailor; here you may
%      roast your goose.

%      Knocking within

%      Knock,
%      knock; never at quiet! What are you? But
%      this place is too cold for hell. I'll devil-porter
%      it no further: I had thought to have let in
%      some of all professions that go the primrose
%      way to the everlasting bonfire.

%      Knocking within

%      Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the porter.

%      Opens the gate

%      Enter MACDUFF and LENNOX

% MACDUFF

%      Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed,
%      That you do lie so late?

% Porter

%      'Faith sir, we were carousing till the
%      second cock: and drink, sir, is a great
%      provoker of three things.

% MACDUFF

%      What three things does drink especially provoke?

% Porter

%      Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and
%      urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes;
%      it provokes the desire, but it takes
%      away the performance: therefore, much drink
%      may be said to be an equivocator with lechery:
%      it makes him, and it mars him; it sets
%      him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him,
%      and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and
%      not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him
%      in a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him.

% MACDUFF

%      I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.

% Porter

%      That it did, sir, i' the very throat on
%      me: but I requited him for his lie; and, I
%      think, being too strong for him, though he took
%      up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to cast
%      him.

% MACDUFF

%      Is thy master stirring?

%      Enter MACBETH

%      Our knocking has awaked him; here he comes.

% LENNOX

%      Good morrow, noble sir.

% MACBETH

%      Good morrow, both.

% MACDUFF

%      Is the king stirring, worthy thane?

% MACBETH

%      Not yet.

% MACDUFF

%      He did command me to call timely on him:
%      I have almost slipp'd the hour.

% MACBETH

%      I'll bring you to him.

% MACDUFF

%      I know this is a joyful trouble to you;
%      But yet 'tis one.

% MACBETH

%      The labour we delight in physics pain.
%      This is the door.

% MACDUFF

%      I'll make so bold to call,
%      For 'tis my limited service.

%      Exit

% LENNOX

%      Goes the king hence to-day?

% MACBETH

%      He does: he did appoint so.

% LENNOX

%      The night has been unruly: where we lay,
%      Our chimneys were blown down; and, as they say,
%      Lamentings heard i' the air; strange screams of death,
%      And prophesying with accents terrible
%      Of dire combustion and confused events
%      New hatch'd to the woeful time: the obscure bird
%      Clamour'd the livelong night: some say, the earth
%      Was feverous and did shake.

% MACBETH

%      'Twas a rough night.

% LENNOX

%      My young remembrance cannot parallel
%      A fellow to it.

%      Re-enter MACDUFF

% MACDUFF

%      O horror, horror, horror! Tongue nor heart
%      Cannot conceive nor name thee!

% MACBETH LENNOX

%      What's the matter.

% MACDUFF

%      Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!
%      Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope
%      The Lord's anointed temple, and stole thence
%      The life o' the building!

% MACBETH

%      What is 't you say? the life?

% LENNOX

%      Mean you his majesty?

% MACDUFF

%      Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight
%      With a new Gorgon: do not bid me speak;
%      See, and then speak yourselves.

%      Exeunt MACBETH and LENNOX

%      Awake, awake!
%      Ring the alarum-bell. Murder and treason!
%      Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! awake!
%      Shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit,
%      And look on death itself! up, up, and see
%      The great doom's image! Malcolm! Banquo!
%      As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites,
%      To countenance this horror! Ring the bell.

%      Bell rings

%      Enter LADY MACBETH

% LADY MACBETH

%      What's the business,
%      That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley
%      The sleepers of the house? speak, speak!

% MACDUFF

%      O gentle lady,
%      'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:
%      The repetition, in a woman's ear,
%      Would murder as it fell.

%      Enter BANQUO

%      O Banquo, Banquo,
%      Our royal master 's murder'd!

% LADY MACBETH

%      Woe, alas!
%      What, in our house?

% BANQUO

%      Too cruel any where.
%      Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself,
%      And say it is not so.

%      Re-enter MACBETH and LENNOX, with ROSS

% MACBETH

%      Had I but died an hour before this chance,
%      I had lived a blessed time; for, from this instant,
%      There 's nothing serious in mortality:
%      All is but toys: renown and grace is dead;
%      The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees
%      Is left this vault to brag of.

%      Enter MALCOLM and DONALBAIN

% DONALBAIN

%      What is amiss?

% MACBETH

%      You are, and do not know't:
%      The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood
%      Is stopp'd; the very source of it is stopp'd.

% MACDUFF

%      Your royal father 's murder'd.

% MALCOLM

%      O, by whom?

% LENNOX

%      Those of his chamber, as it seem'd, had done 't:
%      Their hands and faces were an badged with blood;
%      So were their daggers, which unwiped we found
%      Upon their pillows:
%      They stared, and were distracted; no man's life
%      Was to be trusted with them.

% MACBETH

%      O, yet I do repent me of my fury,
%      That I did kill them.

% MACDUFF

%      Wherefore did you so?

% MACBETH

%      Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious,
%      Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man:
%      The expedition my violent love
%      Outrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,
%      His silver skin laced with his golden blood;
%      And his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature
%      For ruin's wasteful entrance: there, the murderers,
%      Steep'd in the colours of their trade, their daggers
%      Unmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refrain,
%      That had a heart to love, and in that heart
%      Courage to make 's love kno wn?

% LADY MACBETH

%      Help me hence, ho!

% MACDUFF

%      Look to the lady.

% MALCOLM

%      [Aside to DONALBAIN] Why do we hold our tongues,
%      That most may claim this argument for ours?

% DONALBAIN

%      [Aside to MALCOLM] What should be spoken here,
%      where our fate,
%      Hid in an auger-hole, may rush, and seize us?
%      Let 's away;
%      Our tears are not yet brew'd.

% MALCOLM

%      [Aside to DONALBAIN] Nor our strong sorrow
%      Upon the foot of motion.

% BANQUO

%      Look to the lady:

%      LADY MACBETH is carried out

%      And when we have our naked frailties hid,
%      That suffer in exposure, let us meet,
%      And question this most bloody piece of work,
%      To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us:
%      In the great hand of God I stand; and thence
%      Against the undivulged pretence I fight
%      Of treasonous malice.

% MACDUFF

%      And so do I.

% ALL

%      So all.

% MACBETH

%      Let's briefly put on manly readiness,
%      And meet i' the hall together.

% ALL

%      Well contented.

%      Exeunt all but Malcolm and Donalbain.

% MALCOLM

%      What will you do? Let's not consort with them:
%      To show an unfelt sorrow is an office
%      Which the false man does easy. I'll to England.

% DONALBAIN

%      To Ireland, I; our separated fortune
%      Shall keep us both the safer: where we are,
%      There's daggers in men's smiles: the near in blood,
%      The nearer bloody.

% MALCOLM

%      This murderous shaft that's shot
%      Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way
%      Is to avoid the aim. Therefore, to horse;
%      And let us not be dainty of leave-taking,
%      But shift away: there's warrant in that theft
%      Which steals itself, when there's no mercy left.

%      Exeunt

% SCENE IV. Outside Macbeth's castle.

%      Enter ROSS and an old Man

% Old Man

%      Threescore and ten I can remember well:
%      Within the volume of which time I have seen
%      Hours dreadful and things strange; but this sore night
%      Hath trifled former knowings.

% ROSS

%      Ah, good father,
%      Thou seest, the heavens, as troubled with man's act,
%      Threaten his bloody stage: by the clock, 'tis day,
%      And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp:
%      Is't night's predominance, or the day's shame,
%      That darkness does the face of earth entomb,
%      When living light should kiss it?

% Old Man

%      'Tis unnatural,
%      Even like the deed that's done. On Tuesday last,
%      A falcon, towering in her pride of place,
%      Was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd.

% ROSS

%      And Duncan's horses--a thing most strange and certain--
%      Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,
%      Turn'd wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,
%      Contending 'gainst obedience, as they would make
%      War with mankind.

% Old Man

%      'Tis said they eat each other.

% ROSS

%      They did so, to the amazement of mine eyes
%      That look'd upon't. Here comes the good Macduff.

%      Enter MACDUFF

%      How goes the world, sir, now?

% MACDUFF

%      Why, see you not?

% ROSS

%      Is't known who did this more than bloody deed?

% MACDUFF

%      Those that Macbeth hath slain.

% ROSS

%      Alas, the day!
%      What good could they pretend?

% MACDUFF

%      They were suborn'd:
%      Malcolm and Donalbain, the king's two sons,
%      Are stol'n away and fled; which puts upon them
%      Suspicion of the deed.

% ROSS

%      'Gainst nature still!
%      Thriftless ambition, that wilt ravin up
%      Thine own life's means! Then 'tis most like
%      The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.

% MACDUFF

%      He is already named, and gone to Scone
%      To be invested.

% ROSS

%      Where is Duncan's body?

% MACDUFF

%      Carried to Colmekill,
%      The sacred storehouse of his predecessors,
%      And guardian of their bones.

% ROSS

%      Will you to Scone?

% MACDUFF

%      No, cousin, I'll to Fife.

% ROSS

%      Well, I will thither.

% MACDUFF

%      Well, may you see things well done there: adieu!
%      Lest our old robes sit easier than our new!

% ROSS

%      Farewell, father.

% Old Man

%      God's benison go with you; and with those
%      That would make good of bad, and friends of foes!

%      Exeunt
