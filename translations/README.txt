This directory contains shared community translations of various
texts.  As of this writing (Jan 2020) is probably the case that
nothing in here is very relevant.

The file cvs_translation_post is how these documents (at least,
those of them in TeXInfo format) were built, in case you need to
rebuild one.  The output was pushed to
http://www.lojban.org/texts/translations/

The two major ones were Alice, which got taken over by xorxes as he
was the only one doing the work, and is canonically now at
http://alis.lojban.org/, and the Douay-Rheims Bible, which was taken
over by Pierre; see the README in the drbible directory for how to
get access to the current version.
